    drm/i915: extract i915_sysfs.h from i915_drv.h
    
    It used to be handy that we only had a couple of headers, but over time
    i915_drv.h has become unwieldy. Extract declarations to a separate
    header file corresponding to the implementation module, clarifying the
    modularity of the driver.
    
    Ensure the new header is self-contained, and do so with minimal further
    includes, using forward declarations as needed. Include the new header
    only where needed, and sort the modified include directives while at it
    and as needed.
    
    No functional changes.
