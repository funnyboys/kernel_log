    drm/i915: make more headers self-contained
    
    The headers in the gem/selftests/, gt/selftests, gvt/, selftests/
    directories have never been compile-tested, but it would be possible
    to make them self-contained.
    
    This commit only addresses missing <linux/types.h> and forward
    struct declarations.
