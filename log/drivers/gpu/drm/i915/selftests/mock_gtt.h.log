    drm/i915: make more headers self-contained
    
    The headers in the gem/selftests/, gt/selftests, gvt/, selftests/
    directories have never been compile-tested, but it would be possible
    to make them self-contained.
    
    This commit only addresses missing <linux/types.h> and forward
    struct declarations.

    drm/i915: Rename i915_hw_ppgtt to i915_ppgtt
    
    Keeping the _hw_ in there does not help to distinguish it from its
    only brethren i915_ggtt, so drop it.

    drm/i915/selftests: Create a clean GGTT for vma/gtt selftesting
    
    Some tests (e.g. igt_vma_pin1) presume that we have a completely clean
    GGTT so that it can probe boundaries without fear that something is
    already allocated there. However, the mock device is starting to get
    complicated and following similar rules to the live device, i.e. we
    can't guarantee that i915->ggtt remains clean, so create a temporary
    address_space equivalent to the mock ggtt for the purpose.

    drm/i915: Mock a GGTT for self-testing
    
    A very simple mockery, just a random manager and timeline. Useful for
    inserting objects and ordering retirement; and not much else.
    
    v2: mock_fini_ggtt() to complement mock_init_ggtt().
