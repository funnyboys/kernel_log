    drm/i915: make more headers self-contained
    
    The headers in the gem/selftests/, gt/selftests, gvt/, selftests/
    directories have never been compile-tested, but it would be possible
    to make them self-contained.
    
    This commit only addresses missing <linux/types.h> and forward
    struct declarations.

    drm/i915: introduce intel_memory_region
    
    Support memory regions, as defined by a given (start, end), and allow
    creating GEM objects which are backed by said region. The immediate goal
    here is to have something to represent our device memory, but later on
    we also want to represent every memory domain with a region, so stolen,
    shmem, and of course device. At some point we are probably going to want
    use a common struct here, such that we are better aligned with say TTM.
