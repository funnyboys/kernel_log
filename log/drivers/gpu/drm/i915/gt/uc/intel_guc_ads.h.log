commit 0f261b241d9cd01d58dce85a35df26fd38320b10
Author: Daniele Ceraolo Spurio <daniele.ceraolospurio@intel.com>
Date:   Sat Jul 13 11:00:11 2019 +0100

    drm/i915/uc: move GuC and HuC files under gt/uc/
    
    Both microcontrollers are part of the GT HW and are closely related to
    GT operations. To keep all the files cleanly together, they've been
    placed in their own subdir inside the gt/ folder
