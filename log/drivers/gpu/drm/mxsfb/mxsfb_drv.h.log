    drm/mxsfb: Update mxsfb to support a bridge
    
    Currently, the MXSFB DRM driver only supports a panel. But, its output
    display signal can also be redirected to another encoder, like a DSI
    controller. In this case, that DSI controller may act like a drm_bridge.
    In order support this use-case too, this patch adds support for drm_bridge
    in mxsfb.

    drm/mxsfb: Use drm_fbdev_generic_setup()
    
    The CMA helper is already using the drm_fb_helper_generic_probe part of
    the generic fbdev emulation. This patch makes full use of the generic
    fbdev emulation by using its drm_client callbacks. This means that
    drm_mode_config_funcs->output_poll_changed and drm_driver->lastclose are
    now handled by the emulation code. Additionally fbdev unregister happens
    automatically on drm_dev_unregister().
    
    The drm_fbdev_generic_setup() call is put after drm_dev_register() in the
    driver. This is done to highlight the fact that fbdev emulation is an
    internal client that makes use of the driver, it is not part of the
    driver as such. If fbdev setup fails, an error is printed, but the driver
    succeeds probing.

    drm: Add new driver for MXSFB controller
    
    Add new driver for the MXSFB controller found in i.MX23/28/6SX .
    The MXSFB controller is a simple framebuffer controller with one
    parallel LCD output. Unlike the MXSFB fbdev driver that is used
    on these systems now, this driver uses the DRM/KMS framework.
