    drm/meson: add mode selection limits against specific SoC revisions
    
    The Amlogic S805X/Y uses the same die as the S905X, but with more
    limited graphics capabilities.
    
    This adds a soc version detection adding specific limitations on the HDMI
    mode selections.
    
    Here, we limit to HDMI 1.2a max HDMI PHY clock frequency.
    
    Changes sinces v1:
    - Moved frequency check in the vclk code, and also checks DMT modes

    drm/meson: vclk: add support for YUV420 setup
    
    This patch adds clocking support for the YUV420 output from the
    Amlogic Meson SoCs Video Processing Unit to the HDMI Controller.
    
    The YUV420 is obtained by generating a YUV444 pixel stream like
    the classic HDMI display modes, but then the Video Encoder output
    can be configured to down-sample the YUV444 pixel stream to a YUV420
    stream.
    
    This mode needs a different clock generation scheme since the TMDS PHY
    clock must match the 10x ratio with the YUV420 pixel clock, but
    the video encoder must run at 2x the pixel clock.
    
    This patch adds the TMDS PHY clock value in all the video clock setup
    in order to better support these specific uses cases and switch
    to the Common Clock framework for clocks handling in the future.

    drm/meson: drop use of drmP.h
    
    Drop use of the deprecated drmP.h header.
    While doing so used the opportunity
    to clean up a little so includes are now
    sorted and removed unused include files.
    In a few cases added some forwards to allow header
    files to built in different include order.

    drm/meson: Add support for VIC alternate timings
    
    This change is an attempt to handle the alternate clock for the CEA mode.
    60Hz vs. 59.94Hz, 30Hz vs 29.97Hz or 24Hz vs 23.97Hz on the Amlogic Meson SoC
    DRM Driver pixel clock generation.
    
    The actual clock generation will be moved to the Common Clock framework once
    all the video clock are handled by the Amlogic Meson SoC clock driver,
    then these alternate timings will be handled in the same time in a cleaner
    fashion.

    drm/meson: Make DMT timings parameters and pixel clock generic
    
    Remove the modes timings tables for DMT modes and calculate the HW
    paremeters from the modes timings.
    
    Switch the DMT modes pixel clock calculation out of the static frequency
    list to a generic calculation from a range of possible PLL dividers.
    
    This patch is an intermediate step towards usage of the Common Clock
    Framwework for PLL setup, by reworking the code to have common
    sel_pll() function called by the CEA (HDMI) freq setup and the generic
    DMT frequencies setup, we should be able to simply call clk_set_rate()
    on the PLL clock handle in a near future.
    
    The CEA (HDMI) and CVBS modes needs very specific clock paths that CCF will
    never be able to determine by itself, so there is still some work to do for
    a full handoff to CCF handling the clocks.
    
    This setup permits setting non-CEA modes like :
    - 1600x900-60Hz
    - 1280x1024-75Hz
    - 1280x1024-60Hz
    - 1440x900-60Hz
    - 1366x768-60Hz
    - 1280x800-60Hz
    - 1152x864-75Hz
    - 1024x768-75Hz
    - 1024x768-70Hz
    - 1024x768-60Hz
    - 832x624-75Hz
    - 800x600-75Hz

    drm: Add support for Amlogic Meson Graphic Controller
    
    The Amlogic Meson Display controller is composed of several components :
    
    DMC|---------------VPU (Video Processing Unit)----------------|------HHI------|
       | vd1   _______     _____________    _________________     |               |
    D  |-------|      |----|            |   |                |    |   HDMI PLL    |
    D  | vd2   | VIU  |    | Video Post |   | Video Encoders |<---|-----VCLK      |
    R  |-------|      |----| Processing |   |                |    |               |
       | osd2  |      |    |            |---| Enci ----------|----|-----VDAC------|
    R  |-------| CSC  |----| Scalers    |   | Encp ----------|----|----HDMI-TX----|
    A  | osd1  |      |    | Blenders   |   | Encl ----------|----|---------------|
    M  |-------|______|----|____________|   |________________|    |               |
    ___|__________________________________________________________|_______________|
    
    VIU: Video Input Unit
    ---------------------
    
    The Video Input Unit is in charge of the pixel scanout from the DDR memory.
    It fetches the frames addresses, stride and parameters from the "Canvas" memory.
    This part is also in charge of the CSC (Colorspace Conversion).
    It can handle 2 OSD Planes and 2 Video Planes.
    
    VPP: Video Post Processing
    --------------------------
    
    The Video Post Processing is in charge of the scaling and blending of the
    various planes into a single pixel stream.
    There is a special "pre-blending" used by the video planes with a dedicated
    scaler and a "post-blending" to merge with the OSD Planes.
    The OSD planes also have a dedicated scaler for one of the OSD.
    
    VENC: Video Encoders
    --------------------
    
    The VENC is composed of the multiple pixel encoders :
     - ENCI : Interlace Video encoder for CVBS and Interlace HDMI
     - ENCP : Progressive Video Encoder for HDMI
     - ENCL : LCD LVDS Encoder
    The VENC Unit gets a Pixel Clocks (VCLK) from a dedicated HDMI PLL and clock
    tree and provides the scanout clock to the VPP and VIU.
    The ENCI is connected to a single VDAC for Composite Output.
    The ENCI and ENCP are connected to an on-chip HDMI Transceiver.
    
    This driver is a DRM/KMS driver using the following DRM components :
     - GEM-CMA
     - PRIME-CMA
     - Atomic Modesetting
     - FBDev-CMA
    
    For the following SoCs :
     - GXBB Family (S905)
     - GXL Family (S905X, S905D)
     - GXM Family (S912)
    
    The current driver only supports the CVBS PAL/NTSC output modes, but the
    CRTC/Planes management should support bigger modes.
    But Advanced Colorspace Conversion, Scaling and HDMI Modes will be added in
    a second time.
    
    The Device Tree bindings makes use of the endpoints video interface definitions
    to connect to the optional CVBS and in the future the HDMI Connector nodes.
    
    HDMI Support is planned for a next release.
