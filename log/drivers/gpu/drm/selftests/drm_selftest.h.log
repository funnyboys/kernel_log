    drm: Add some kselftests for the DRM range manager (struct drm_mm)
    
    First we introduce a smattering of infrastructure for writing selftests.
    The idea is that we have a test module that exercises a particular
    portion of the exported API, and that module provides a set of tests
    that can either be run as an ensemble via kselftest or individually via
    an igt harness (in this case igt/drm_mm). To accommodate selecting
    individual tests, we export a boolean parameter to control selection of
    each test - that is hidden inside a bunch of reusable boilerplate macros
    to keep writing the tests simple.
    
    v2: Choose a random random_seed unless one is specified by the user.
    v3: More parameters to control max_iterations and max_prime of the
    tests.
    
    Testcase: igt/drm_mm
