commit 5ffa31ed4e122fe5020fa1fa1fc486747c25705e

    drm/gma500: make local header files more self-contained
    
    Add proper forward declarations to minimize dependencies on
    other header files.
    
    Just add enough that we can safely include all header files in
    alphabetically order in relevant files.

    drm/gma500: Add first piece of blitter code
    
    Right now, all we need to know about the blitter is that it's not doing
    anything that can be messed up when fiddling with MMU mappings.
