commit 026abc333205c1fff80138b8c2cac3d0347685f4

    gma500: initial medfield merge
    
    We need to merge this ahead of some of the cleanup because a lot of needed
    cleanup spans both new and old chips. If we try and clean up and the merge
    we end up fighting ourselves.

    [With a load of the cleanup stuff folded in, register stuff reworked sanely]
