    drm/gma500: make local header files more self-contained
    
    Add proper forward declarations to minimize dependencies on
    other header files.
    
    Just add enough that we can safely include all header files in
    alphabetically order in relevant files.

    gma500: Add the glue to the various BIOS and firmware interfaces
    
    Some of this should one day become a library shared by i915 and gma500 I
    suspct. Best however to deal with that later once it is all nice and
    stably merged.
