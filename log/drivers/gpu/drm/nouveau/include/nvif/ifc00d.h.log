    drm/nouveau/mmu/gp100-: support vmms with gcc/tex replayable faults enabled
    
    Some GPU units are capable of supporting "replayable" page faults, where
    the execution unit will wait for SW to fixup GPU page tables rather than
    triggering a channel-fatal fault.
    
    This feature isn't useful (it's harmful, even) unless something like HMM
    is being used to manage events appearing in the replayable fault buffer,
    so, it's disabled by default.
    
    This commit allows a client to request it be enabled.

    drm/nouveau/mmu/gp100-: add privileged methods for fault replay/cancel
    
    Host methods exist to do at least some of what we need, but we are not
    currently pushing replay/cancels through a channel like UVM does as it's
    not clear whether it's necessary in our case (UVM also updates PTEs with
    the GPU).
    
    UVM also pushes a software method for fault cancels on Pascal, seemingly
    because the host methods don't appear to be sufficient.  If/when we want
    to push the replay/cancel on the GPU, we can re-purpose the cancellation
    code here to implement that swmthd.
    
    Keep it simple for now, until we figure out exactly what we need here.

    drm/nouveau/mmu/gp100,gp10b: implement new vmm backend
    
    Adds support for:
    - 64KiB/2MiB big page sizes (128KiB not supported by HW with new PT layout).
    - System-memory PTs.
    - LPTE "invalid" state.
    - (Tegra) Use of video memory aperture.
    - Sparse PDEs/PTEs.
    - Additional blocklinear kinds.
    - 49-bit address-space.
    
    GP100 supports an entirely new 5-level page table layout that provides
    an expanded 49-bit address-space.  It also supports the layout present
    on previous generations, which we've been making do with until now.
    
    This commit implements support for the new layout, and enables it by
    default.

    drm/nouveau/mmu/gp100,gp10b: implement vmm on top of new base
    
    Adds support for:
    - Selection of old/new-style page table layout (GP100MmuLayout=0/1).
    - System-memory PDs.
    
    New layout disabled by default for the moment, as we don't have a
    backend that can handle it yet.
