    drm/nouveau: fix bogus GPL-2 license header
    
    The bulk SPDX addition made all these files into GPL-2.0 licensed files.
    However the remainder of the project is MIT-licensed, these files
    (primarily header files) were simply missing the boiler plate and got
    caught up in the global update.
    
    Fixes: b24413180f5 (License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license)

    drm/nouveau/nvif: remove const attribute from nvif_mclass
    
    Similar to commit 0bf8bf50eddc ("module: Remove
    const attribute from alias for MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE")
    
    Fixes many -Wduplicate-decl-specifier warnings due to the combination of
    const typeof() of already const variables.

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd
Author: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 1 15:07:57 2017 +0100

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

commit 01326050391ceee2cf1b6c91c108414a35f40861
Author: Ben Skeggs <bskeggs@redhat.com>
Date:   Wed Nov 1 03:56:19 2017 +1000

    drm/nouveau/core/object: allow arguments to be passed to map function
    
    MMU will be needing this to specify kind info on BAR mappings.
    
    We have no userspace currently using these interfaces, so break the ABI
    instead of supporting both.  NVIF version bump so any future use can be
    guarded.

    drm/nouveau/nvif: simplify and tidy library interfaces
    
    A variety of tweaks to the NVIF library interfaces, mostly ripping out
    things that turned out to be not so useful.
    
    - Removed refcounting from nvif_object, callers are expected to not be
      stupid instead.
    - nvif_client is directly reachable from anything derived from nvif_object,
      removing the need for heuristics to locate it
    - _new() versions of interfaces, that allocate memory for the object
      they construct, have been removed.  The vast majority of callers used
      the embedded _init() interfaces.
    - No longer storing constructor arguments (and the data returned from
      nvkm) inside nvif_object, it's more or less unused and just wastes
      memory.

commit be83cd4ef9a2a56bd35550bf96146b7b837daf02
Author: Ben Skeggs <bskeggs@redhat.com>

    drm/nouveau: finalise nvkm namespace switch (no binary change)
    
    The namespace of NVKM is being changed to nvkm_ instead of nouveau_,
    which will be used for the DRM part of the driver.  This is being
    done in order to make it very clear as to what part of the driver a
    given symbol belongs to, and as a minor step towards splitting the
    DRM driver out to be able to stand on its own (for virt).
    
    Because there's already a large amount of churn here anyway, this is
    as good a time as any to also switch to NVIDIA's device and chipset
    naming to ease collaboration with them.
    
    A comparison of objdump disassemblies proves no code changes.

    drm/nouveau/nvif: namespace of nvkm accessors (no binary change)
    
    NVKM is having it's namespace switched to nvkm_, which will conflict
    with these functions (which are workarounds for the fact that as of
    yet, we still aren't able to split DRM and NVKM completely).
    
    A comparison of objdump disassemblies proves no code changes.

commit c39f472e9f14e49a9bc091977ced0ec45fc00c57

    drm/nouveau: remove symlinks, move core/ to nvkm/ (no code changes)
    
    The symlinks were annoying some people, and they're not used anywhere
    else in the kernel tree.  The include directory structure has been
    changed so that symlinks aren't needed anymore.
    
    NVKM has been moved from core/ to nvkm/ to make it more obvious as to
    what the directory is for, and as some minor prep for when NVKM gets
    split out into its own module (virt) at a later date.
