    drm/nouveau: drop drmP.h from all header files
    
    Drop include of the deprecated drmP.h from all nouveau heder files.
    This allows us to remove drmP.h from all .c files without any
    side-effects in a follow-up commit.
    
    Build tested using allyeyconfig and allmodconfig

    drm/nouveau: Fill out gem_object->resv
    
    That way we can ditch our gem_prime_res_obj implementation. Since ttm
    absolutely needs the right reservation object all the boilerplate is
    already there and we just have to wire it up correctly.
    
    Note that gem/prime doesn't care when we do this, as long as we do it
    before the bo is registered and someone can call the handle2fd ioctl
    on it.
    
    Aside: ttm_buffer_object.ttm_resv could probably be ditched in favour
    of always passing a non-NULL resv to ttm_bo_init(). At least for gem
    drivers that would avoid having two of these, on in ttm_buffer_object
    and the other in drm_gem_object, one just there for confusion.

    drm/nouveau: fix bogus GPL-2 license header
    
    The bulk SPDX addition made all these files into GPL-2.0 licensed files.
    However the remainder of the project is MIT-licensed, these files
    (primarily header files) were simply missing the boiler plate and got
    caught up in the global update.

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd
Author: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 1 15:07:57 2017 +0100

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    drm: kill ->gem_init_object() and friends
    
    All drivers embed gem-objects into their own buffer objects. There is no
    reason to keep drm_gem_object_alloc(), gem->driver_private and
    ->gem_init_object() anymore.
    
    New drivers are highly encouraged to do the same. There is no benefit in
    allocating gem-objects separately.

    drm/nouveau: embed gem object in nouveau_bo
    
    There is no reason to keep the gem object separately allocated. nouveau is
    the last user of gem_obj->driver_private, so if we embed it, we can get
    rid of 8bytes per gem-object.
    
    The implementation follows the radeon driver. bo->gem is only valid, iff
    the bo was created via the gem helpers _and_ iff the user holds a valid
    gem reference. That is, as the gem object holds a reference to the
    nouveau_bo. If you use nouveau_ref() to gain a bo reference, you are not
    guaranteed to also hold a gem reference. The gem object might get
    destroyed after the last user drops the gem-ref via
    drm_gem_object_unreference(). Use drm_gem_object_reference() to gain a
    gem-reference.
    
    For debugging, we can use bo->gem.filp != NULL to test whether a gem-bo is
    valid. However, this shouldn't be used for real functionality to avoid
    gem-internal dependencies.
    
    Note that the implementation follows the previous style. However, we no
    longer can check for bo->gem != NULL to test for a valid gem object. This
    wasn't done before, so we should be safe now.

    Merge branch 'drm-next' of git://people.freedesktop.org/~airlied/linux
    
    Pull drm merge (part 1) from Dave Airlie:
     "So first of all my tree and uapi stuff has a conflict mess, its my
      fault as the nouveau stuff didn't hit -next as were trying to rebase
      regressions out of it before we merged.
    
      Highlights:
       - SH mobile modesetting driver and associated helpers
       - some DRM core documentation
       - i915 modesetting rework, haswell hdmi, haswell and vlv fixes, write
         combined pte writing, ilk rc6 support,
       - nouveau: major driver rework into a hw core driver, makes features
         like SLI a lot saner to implement,
       - psb: add eDP/DP support for Cedarview
       - radeon: 2 layer page tables, async VM pte updates, better PLL
         selection for > 2 screens, better ACPI interactions
    
      The rest is general grab bag of fixes.
    
      So why part 1? well I have the exynos pull req which came in a bit
      late but was waiting for me to do something they shouldn't have and it
      looks fairly safe, and David Howells has some more header cleanups
      he'd like me to pull, that seem like a good idea, but I'd like to get
      this merge out of the way so -next dosen't get blocked."
    
    Tons of conflicts mostly due to silly include line changes, but mostly
    mindless.  A few other small semantic conflicts too, noted from Dave's
    pre-merged branch.
