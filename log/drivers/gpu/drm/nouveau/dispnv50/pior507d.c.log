    drm/nouveau/kms/nv50-: Probe SOR and PIOR caps for DP interlacing support
    
    Right now, we make the mistake of allowing interlacing on all
    connectors. Nvidia hardware does not always support interlacing with DP
    though, so we need to make sure that we don't allow interlaced modes to
    be set in such situations as otherwise we'll end up accidentally hanging
    the display HW.
    
    This fixes some hangs with Turing, which would be caused by attempting
    to set an interlaced mode on hardware that doesn't support it. This
    patch likely fixes other hardware hanging in the same way as well.
    
    Note that we say we probe PIOR caps, but they don't actually have any
    interlacing caps. So, the get_caps() function for PIORs just sets
    interlacing support to true.
    
    Changes since v1:
    * Actually probe caps correctly this time, both on EVO and NVDisplay.
    Changes since v2:
    * Fix probing for < GF119
    * Use vfunc table, in prep for adding more caps in the future.
