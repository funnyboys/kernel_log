commit 53e0a3e70de69dc9f498d26c6b5495b2771ee374
Author: Ben Skeggs <bskeggs@redhat.com>

    drm/nouveau/kms/nv50-: simplify tracking of channel interlocks
    
    Instead of windows returning their core channel interlock mask if they
    know core has been modified, it's recorded unconditionally and used if
    required when update methods are emitted.
    
    This will be required to support Volta.
