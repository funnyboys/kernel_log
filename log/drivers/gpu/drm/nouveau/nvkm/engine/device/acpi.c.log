    drm/nouveau/device: namespace + nvidia gpu names (no binary change)
    
    The namespace of NVKM is being changed to nvkm_ instead of nouveau_,
    which will be used for the DRM part of the driver.  This is being
    done in order to make it very clear as to what part of the driver a
    given symbol belongs to, and as a minor step towards splitting the
    DRM driver out to be able to stand on its own (for virt).
    
    Because there's already a large amount of churn here anyway, this is
    as good a time as any to also switch to NVIDIA's device and chipset
    naming to ease collaboration with them.
    
    A comparison of objdump disassemblies proves no code changes.

    drm/nouveau: remove symlinks, move core/ to nvkm/ (no code changes)
    
    The symlinks were annoying some people, and they're not used anywhere
    else in the kernel tree.  The include directory structure has been
    changed so that symlinks aren't needed anymore.
    
    NVKM has been moved from core/ to nvkm/ to make it more obvious as to
    what the directory is for, and as some minor prep for when NVKM gets
    split out into its own module (virt) at a later date.
