    drm/nouveau/fb: namespace + nvidia gpu names (no binary change)
    
    The namespace of NVKM is being changed to nvkm_ instead of nouveau_,
    which will be used for the DRM part of the driver.  This is being
    done in order to make it very clear as to what part of the driver a
    given symbol belongs to, and as a minor step towards splitting the
    DRM driver out to be able to stand on its own (for virt).
    
    Because there's already a large amount of churn here anyway, this is
    as good a time as any to also switch to NVIDIA's device and chipset
    naming to ease collaboration with them.
    
    A comparison of objdump disassemblies proves no code changes.
