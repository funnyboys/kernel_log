    drm/nouveau/fb: finalise big page size selection in constructor
    
    MMU will need to know this during its constructor, so we can't delay
    deciding this until init-time.

    drm/nouveau/fb/gf100-: allow selection of an alternate big page size
    
    GFxxx/GM1xx support the selection of 64/128KiB big pages globally.
    
    GM2xx supports the same, as well as another mode where the page size
    can be selected per-instance.
    
    We default to 128KiB pages (With per-instance for GM200, but the current
    code selects 128KiB there already) as the MMU code isn't currently able
    to handle otherwise.

    drm/nouveau/fb: namespace + nvidia gpu names (no binary change)
    
    The namespace of NVKM is being changed to nvkm_ instead of nouveau_,
    which will be used for the DRM part of the driver.  This is being
    done in order to make it very clear as to what part of the driver a
    given symbol belongs to, and as a minor step towards splitting the
    DRM driver out to be able to stand on its own (for virt).
    
    Because there's already a large amount of churn here anyway, this is
    as good a time as any to also switch to NVIDIA's device and chipset
    naming to ease collaboration with them.
    
    A comparison of objdump disassemblies proves no code changes.

    drm/nouveau: remove symlinks, move core/ to nvkm/ (no code changes)
    
    The symlinks were annoying some people, and they're not used anywhere
    else in the kernel tree.  The include directory structure has been
    changed so that symlinks aren't needed anymore.
    
    NVKM has been moved from core/ to nvkm/ to make it more obvious as to
    what the directory is for, and as some minor prep for when NVKM gets
    split out into its own module (virt) at a later date.
