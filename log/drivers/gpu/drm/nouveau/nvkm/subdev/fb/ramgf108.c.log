    drm/nouveau/fb/gf100-: declare constants as unsigned long long.
    
    Explicitly declare constants as unsigned long long to address the
    following sparse warnings:
    warning: constant is so big it is long
    
    v2: convert to unsigned long long for compatibility with 32-bit
    architectures.

    drm/nouveau/fb/gf100-: rework ram detection
    
    This commit reworks the RAM detection algorithm, using RAM-per-LTC to
    determine whether a board has a mixed-memory configuration instead of
    using RAM-per-FBPA.  I'm not certain the algorithm is perfect, but it
    should handle all currently known configurations in the very least.
    
    This should fix GTX 970 boards with 4GiB of RAM where the last 512MiB
    isn't fully accessible, as well as only detecting half the VRAM on
    GF108 boards.
    
    As a nice side-effect, GP10x memory detection now reuses the majority
    of the code from earlier chipsets.
