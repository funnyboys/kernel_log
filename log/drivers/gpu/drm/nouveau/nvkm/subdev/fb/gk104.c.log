    drm/nouveau: Add support for BLCG on Kepler1
    
    This enables BLCG optimization for kepler1. When using clockgating,
    nvidia's firmware has a set of registers which are initially programmed
    by the vbios with various engine delays and other mysterious settings
    that are safe enough to bring up the GPU. However, the values used by
    the vbios are more power hungry then they need to be, so the nvidia driver
    writes it's own more optimized set of BLCG settings before enabling
    CG_CTRL. This adds support for programming the optimized BLCG values
    during engine/subdev init, which enables rather significant power
    savings.
    
    This introduces the nvkm_therm_clkgate_init() helper, which we use to
    program the optimized BLCG settings before enabling clockgating with
    nvkm_therm_clkgate_enable.
    
    As well, this commit shares a lot more code with Fermi since BLCG is
    mostly the same there as far as we can tell. In the future, it's likely
    we'll reformat the clkgate_packs for kepler1 so that they share a list
    of mmio packs with Fermi.

    drm/nouveau/fb/gf100-: allow selection of an alternate big page size
    
    GFxxx/GM1xx support the selection of 64/128KiB big pages globally.
    
    GM2xx supports the same, as well as another mode where the page size
    can be selected per-instance.
    
    We default to 128KiB pages (With per-instance for GM200, but the current
    code selects 128KiB there already) as the MMU code isn't currently able
    to handle otherwise.

    drm/nouveau/fb: namespace + nvidia gpu names (no binary change)
    
    The namespace of NVKM is being changed to nvkm_ instead of nouveau_,
    which will be used for the DRM part of the driver.  This is being
    done in order to make it very clear as to what part of the driver a
    given symbol belongs to, and as a minor step towards splitting the
    DRM driver out to be able to stand on its own (for virt).
    
    Because there's already a large amount of churn here anyway, this is
    as good a time as any to also switch to NVIDIA's device and chipset
    naming to ease collaboration with them.
    
    A comparison of objdump disassemblies proves no code changes.
