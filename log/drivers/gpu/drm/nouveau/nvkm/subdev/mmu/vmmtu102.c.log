    drm/nouveau/mmu/gp100-: support vmms with gcc/tex replayable faults enabled
    
    Some GPU units are capable of supporting "replayable" page faults, where
    the execution unit will wait for SW to fixup GPU page tables rather than
    triggering a channel-fatal fault.
    
    This feature isn't useful (it's harmful, even) unless something like HMM
    is being used to manage events appearing in the replayable fault buffer,
    so, it's disabled by default.
    
    This commit allows a client to request it be enabled.

    drm/nouveau/mmu/gp100-: add privileged methods for fault replay/cancel
    
    Host methods exist to do at least some of what we need, but we are not
    currently pushing replay/cancels through a channel like UVM does as it's
    not clear whether it's necessary in our case (UVM also updates PTEs with
    the GPU).
    
    UVM also pushes a software method for fault cancels on Pascal, seemingly
    because the host methods don't appear to be sufficient.  If/when we want
    to push the replay/cancel on the GPU, we can re-purpose the cancellation
    code here to implement that swmthd.
    
    Keep it simple for now, until we figure out exactly what we need here.

    drm/nouveau/mmu: support initialisation of client-managed address-spaces
    
    NVKM is currently responsible for managing the allocation of a client's
    GPU address-space, but there's various use-cases (ie. HMM address-space
    mirroring) where giving a client more direct control is desirable.
    
    This commit allows for a VMM to be created where the area allocated for
    NVKM is limited to a client-specified window, the remainder of address-
    space is controlled directly by the client.
    
    Leaving a window is necessary to support various internal requirements,
    but also to support existing allocation interfaces as not all of the HW
    is capable of working with a HMM allocation.
