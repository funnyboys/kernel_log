    drm/nouveau/mmu: support initialisation of client-managed address-spaces
    
    NVKM is currently responsible for managing the allocation of a client's
    GPU address-space, but there's various use-cases (ie. HMM address-space
    mirroring) where giving a client more direct control is desirable.
    
    This commit allows for a VMM to be created where the area allocated for
    NVKM is limited to a client-specified window, the remainder of address-
    space is controlled directly by the client.
    
    Leaving a window is necessary to support various internal requirements,
    but also to support existing allocation interfaces as not all of the HW
    is capable of working with a HMM allocation.

    drm/nouveau/mmu/gf100-: virtualise setting pdb base address for invalidation
    
    It appears that Pascal and newer need something different.

    drm/nouveau/mmu/gk104,gk20a: implement new vmm backend
    
    Adds support for:
    - 64KiB big page size.
    - System-memory PTs.
    - LPTE "invalid" state.
    - (Tegra) Use of video memory aperture.
    
    Adds support for marking LPTEs invalid, resulting in the corresponding
    SPTEs being ignored, which is supposed to speed up TLB invalidates.
    
    On The Tegra side, this will switch to using the video memory aperture
    for all mappings.  The HW will still target non-coherent system memory,
    but this aperture needs to be selected in order to support compression.
    
    Tegra's instmem backend somewhat cheated to get this effect previously.
