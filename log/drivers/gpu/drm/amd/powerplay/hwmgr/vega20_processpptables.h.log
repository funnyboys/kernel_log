    drm/amd/powerplay: add the hw manager for vega20 (v3)
    
    hwmgr is the interface for the driver to setup state
    structures which are used by the smu for managing the
    power state.
    
    v2: squash in fixes:
    - update set_watermarks_for_clocks_ranges to use common code
    - drop unsupported apis
    - correct MAX_REGULAR_DPM_NUMBER value
    - multimonitor fixes
    - add check for vbios pptable version
    - revise dpm table setup
    - init fclk dpm state
    - Remove unused definition in vega20_hwmgr
    - support power limit setup
    - enable vega20 to honour DAL clock limits
    - comment out dump_table debugging
    v3: switch to SOC15 register access macros
