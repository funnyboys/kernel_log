    drm/amdgpu: rework IP block registration (v2)
    
    This makes it easier to replace specific IP blocks on
    asics for handling virtual_dce, DAL, etc. and for building
    IP lists for hw or tables.  This also stored the status
    information in the same structure.
    
    v2: split out spelling fix into a separate patch
        add a function to add IPs to the list
