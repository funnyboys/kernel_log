    drm/amdgpu: Enable reading FRU chip via I2C v3
    
    Allow for reading of information like manufacturer, product number
    and serial number from the FRU chip. Report the serial number as
    the new sysfs file serial_number. Note that this only works on
    server cards, as consumer cards do not feature the FRU chip, which
    contains this information.
    
    v2: Add documentation to amdgpu.rst, add helper functions,
        rename functions for consistency, fix bad starting offset
    v3: Remove testing definitions
