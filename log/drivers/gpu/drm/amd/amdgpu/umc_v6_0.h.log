    drm/amdgpu: fix an UMC hw arbitrator bug(v3)
    
    issue:
    the UMC6 h/w bug is that when MCLK is doing the switch
    in the middle of a page access being preempted by high
    priority client (e.g. DISPLAY) then UMC and the mclk switch
    would stuck there due to deadlock
    
    how:
    fixed by disabling auto PreChg for UMC to avoid high
    priority client preempting other client's access on
    the same page, thus the deadlock could be avoided
    
    v2:
    put the patch in callback of UMC6
    v3:
    rename the callback to "init_registers"
