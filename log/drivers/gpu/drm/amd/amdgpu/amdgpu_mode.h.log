    drm/amdgpu: Convert to struct drm_crtc_helper_funcs.get_scanout_position()
    
    The callback struct drm_driver.get_scanout_position() is deprecated in
    favor of struct drm_crtc_helper_funcs.get_scanout_position(). Convert
    amdgpu over.

    drm/amd/display: Switch the custom "max bpc" property to the DRM prop
    
    [Why]
    The custom "max bpc" property was added to limit color depth while the
    DRM one was still being merged. It's been a few kernel versions since
    then and this TODO was still sticking around.
    
    [How]
    Attach the DRM max bpc property to the connector and drop all of our
    custom property management. Set the max bpc to 8 by default since
    DRM defaults to the max in the range which would be 16 in this case.
    
    No behavioral changes are intended with this patch, it should just be
    a refactor.
    
    v2: Don't force 8bpc when no state is given

    drm/amd/display: Rework vrr flip throttling for late vblank irq.
    
    For throttling to work correctly, we always need a baseline vblank
    count last_flip_vblank that increments at start of front-porch.
    
    This is the case for drm_crtc_vblank_count() in non-VRR mode, where
    the vblank irq fires at start of front-porch and triggers DRM core
    vblank handling, but it is no longer the case in VRR mode, where
    core vblank handling is done later, after end of front-porch.
    
    Therefore drm_crtc_vblank_count() is no longer useful for this.
    We also can't use drm_crtc_accurate_vblank_count(), as that would
    screw up vblank timestamps in VRR mode when called in front-porch.
    
    To solve this, use the cooked hardware vblank counter returned by
    amdgpu_get_vblank_counter_kms() instead, as that one is cooked to
    always increment at start of front-porch, independent of when
    vblank related irq's fire.
    
    This patch allows vblank irq handling to happen anywhere within
    vblank of even after it, without a negative impact on flip
    throttling, so followup patches can shift the vblank core
    handling trigger point wherever they need it.

    drm/amd/display: Use vrr friendly pageflip throttling in DC.
    
    In VRR mode, keep track of the vblank count of the last
    completed pageflip in amdgpu_crtc->last_flip_vblank, as
    recorded in the pageflip completion handler after each
    completed flip.
    
    Use that count to prevent mmio programming a new pageflip
    within the same vblank in which the last pageflip completed,
    iow. to throttle pageflips to at most one flip per video
    frame, while at the same time allowing to request a flip
    not only before start of vblank, but also anywhere within
    vblank.
    
    The old logic did the same, and made sense for regular fixed
    refresh rate flipping, but in vrr mode it prevents requesting
    a flip anywhere inside the possibly huge vblank, thereby
    reducing framerate in vrr mode instead of improving it, by
    delaying a slightly delayed flip requests up to a maximum
    vblank duration + 1 scanout duration. This would limit VRR
    usefulness to only help applications with a very high GPU
    demand, which can submit the flip request before start of
    vblank, but then have to wait long for fences to complete.
    
    With this method a flip can be both requested and - after
    fences have completed - executed, ie. it doesn't matter if
    the request (amdgpu_dm_do_flip()) gets delayed until deep
    into the extended vblank due to cpu execution delays. This
    also allows clients which want to regulate framerate within
    the vrr range a much more fine-grained control of flip timing,
    a feature that might be useful for video playback, and is
    very useful for neuroscience/vision research applications.
    
    In regular non-VRR mode, retain the old flip submission
    behavior. This to keep flip scheduling for fullscreen X11/GLX
    OpenGL clients intact, if they use the GLX_OML_sync_control
    extensions glXSwapBufferMscOML(, ..., target_msc,...) function
    with a specific target_msc target vblank count.
    
    glXSwapBuffersMscOML() or DRI3/Present PresentPixmap() will
    not flip at the proper target_msc for a non-zero target_msc
    if VRR mode is active with this patch. They'd often flip one
    frame too early. However, this limitation should not matter
    much in VRR mode, as scheduling based on vblank counts is
    pretty futile/unusable under variable refresh duration
    anyway, so no real extra harm is done.

    drm: Split out drm_probe_helper.h
    
    Having the probe helper stuff (which pretty much everyone needs) in
    the drm_crtc_helper.h file (which atomic drivers should never need) is
    confusing. Split them out.
    
    To make sure I actually achieved the goal here I went through all
    drivers. And indeed, all atomic drivers are now free of
    drm_crtc_helper.h includes.
    
    v2: Make it compile. There was so much compile fail on arm drivers
    that I figured I'll better not include any of the acks on v1.
    
    v3: Massive rebase because i915 has lost a lot of drmP.h includes, but
    not all: Through drm_crtc_helper.h > drm_modeset_helper.h -> drmP.h
    there was still one, which this patch largely removes. Which means
    rolling out lots more includes all over.
    
    This will also conflict with ongoing drmP.h cleanup by others I
    expect.
    
    v3: Rebase on top of atomic bochs.
    
    v4: Review from Laurent for bridge/rcar/omap/shmob/core bits:
    - (re)move some of the added includes, use the better include files in
      other places (all suggested from Laurent adopted unchanged).
    - sort alphabetically
    
    v5: Actually try to sort them, and while at it, sort all the ones I
    touch.
    
    v6: Rebase onto i915 changes.
    
    v7: Rebase once more.

    drm/amdgpu: Set FreeSync state using drm VRR properties
    
    Support for AMDGPU specific FreeSync properties and ioctls are dropped
    from amdgpu_dm in favor of supporting drm variable refresh rate
    properties.
    
    The notify_freesync and set_freesync_property functions are dropped
    from amdgpu_display_funcs.
    
    The drm vrr_capable property is now attached to any DP/HDMI connector.
    Its value is updated accordingly to the connector's FreeSync capabiltiy.
    
    The freesync_enable logic and ioctl control has has been dropped in
    favor of utilizing the vrr_enabled on the drm CRTC. This allows for more
    fine grained atomic control over which CRTCs should support variable
    refresh rate.
    
    To handle state changes for vrr_enabled it was easiest to drop the
    forced modeset on freesync_enabled change. This patch now performs the
    required stream updates when planes are flipped.
    
    This is done for a few reasons:
    
    (1) VRR stream updates can be done in the fast update path
    
    (2) amdgpu_dm_atomic_check would need to be hacked apart to check
        desired variable refresh state and capability before the CRTC
        disable pass.
    
    (3) Performing VRR stream updates on-flip is needed for enabling BTR
        support.
    
    VRR packets and timing adjustments are now tracked and compared to
    previous values sent to the hardware.

    drm/amd: Add abm level drm property
    
    Adaptive Backlight Management (ABM) is a feature
    that reduces backlight level to save power, while
    increasing pixel contrast and pixel luminance
    to maintain readability and image quality.
    
    ABM will adjust in response to the
    pixel luminance of the displayed content.
    
    ABM is made available as a drm property on eDP
    monitors called "abm level", which ranges from 0 to 4.
    When this property is set to 0, ABM is off.  Levels 1
    to 4 represent different ranges of backlight reduction.
    At higher levels both the backlight reduction and pixel
    adjustment will be greater.
    
    ABM requires DMCU firmware, which is currently available for
    Raven ASICs only.  If the feature does not work, please
    ensure your firmware is up to date.
    
    v2:
    Fix commit message, only attach property if DMCU loaded
    v3:
    Store ABM level in crtc state to accommodate dc
    v4:
    Fix ABM saving on dpms cycle

    drm/amdgpu: Add amdgpu "max bpc" connector property (v2)
    
    [Why]
    Many panels support more than 8bpc but some modes are unavailable while
    running at greater than 8bpc due to DP/HDMI bandwidth constraints.
    
    Support for more than 8bpc was added recently in the driver but it
    defaults to the maximum supported bpc - locking out these modes.
    
    This should be a user configurable option such that the user can select
    what bpc configuration they would like.
    
    [How]
    This patch introduces the "max bpc" amdgpu driver specific connector
    property so the user can limit the maximum bpc. It ranges from 8 to 16.
    
    This doesn't directly set the preferred bpc for the panel since it
    follows Intel's existing driver conventions.
    
    This proprety should be removed once common drm support for max bpc
    lands.

    drm/amdgpu: Move GEM BO to drm_framebuffer
    
    Since drm_framebuffer can now store GEM objects directly, place them
    there rather than in our own subclass. As this makes the framebuffer
    create_handle and destroy functions the same as the GEM framebuffer
    helper, we can reuse those.

    drm/amdgpu: Use drm_fb_helper_lastclose() and _poll_changed()
    
    This driver can use drm_fb_helper_lastclose() in its .lastclose function.
    It can also use drm_fb_helper_output_poll_changed() as its
    .output_poll_changed callback.
    Remove the unused driver implementations.

    drm/amd/display: update plane functionalities
    
    This patch introduces amdgpu_drm_plane_state
    structure, which subclasses drm_plane_state and
    holds data suitable for configuring hardware.
    
    It switches reset(), atomic_duplicate_state()
    & atomic_destroy_state() functions to new internal
    implementation, earlier they were pointing to
    drm core functions.
    
    TESTS(On Chromium OS on Stoney Only)
    * Builds without compilation errors.
    * 'plane_test' passes for XR24 format
      based Overlay plane.
    * Chromium OS ui comes up.

    drm/amd/display: decouple per-crtc-plane model
    
    Current design has per-crtc-plane model.
    As a result, for asic's that support underlay,
    are unable to expose it to user space for modesetting.
    
    To enable this, the drm driver intialisation now runs
    for number of surfaces instead of stream/crtc.
    
    This patch plumbs surface capabilities to drm framework
    so that it can be effectively used by user space.
    
    Tests: (On Chromium OS for Stoney Only)
    * 'modetest -p'  now shows additional plane
      with YUV capabilities in case of CZ and ST.
    * 'plane_test' fails with below error:
      [drm:amdgpu_dm_connector_atomic_set_property [amdgpu]] *ERROR* Unsupported screen depth 0
      as ther is no support for YUYV
    * Checked multimonitor display works fine

    drm/amd/display: Remove dc_target object
    
    dc_target does not fit well into DRM framework so removed it.
    This will prevent the driver from leveraging the pipe-split
    code for tiled displays, so will have to be handled at a higher
    level.  Most places that used dc_target now directly use dc_stream
    instead.

    The redundant fb helpers .load_lut, .gamma_set and .gamma_get are
    no longer used. Remove the dead code and hook up the crtc .gamma_set
    to use the crtc gamma_store directly instead of duplicating that
    info locally.

    drm/vblank: drop the mode argument from drm_calc_vbltimestamp_from_scanoutpos
    
    If we restrict this helper to only kms drivers (which is the case) we
    can look up the correct mode easily ourselves. But it's a bit tricky:
    
    - All legacy drivers look at crtc->hwmode. But that is updated already
      at the beginning of the modeset helper, which means when we disable
      a pipe. Hence the final timestamps might be a bit off. But since
      this is an existing bug I'm not going to change it, but just try to
      be bug-for-bug compatible with the current code. This only applies
      to radeon&amdgpu.
    
    - i915 tries to get it perfect by updating crtc->hwmode when the pipe
      is off (i.e. vblank->enabled = false).
    
    - All other atomic drivers look at crtc->state->adjusted_mode. Those
      that look at state->requested_mode simply don't adjust their mode,
      so it's the same. That has two problems: Accessing crtc->state from
      interrupt handling code is unsafe, and it's updated before we shut
      down the pipe. For nonblocking modesets it's even worse.
    
    For atomic drivers try to implement what i915 does. To do that we add
    a new hwmode field to the vblank structure, and update it from
    drm_calc_timestamping_constants(). For atomic drivers that's called
    from the right spot by the helper library already, so all fine. But
    for safety let's enforce that.
    
    For legacy driver this function is only called at the end (oh the
    fun), which is broken, so again let's not bother and just stay
    bug-for-bug compatible.
    
    The  benefit is that we can use drm_calc_vbltimestamp_from_scanoutpos
    directly to implement ->get_vblank_timestamp in every driver, deleting
    a lot of code.
    
    v2: Completely new approach, trying to mimick the i915 solution.
    
    v3: Fixup kerneldoc.
    
    v4: Drop the WARN_ON to check that the vblank is off, atomic helpers
    currently unconditionally call this. Recomputing the same stuff should
    be harmless.
    
    v5: Fix typos and move misplaced hunks to the right patches (Neil).
    
    v6: Undo hunk movement (kbuild).

    This reverts commit cb341a319f7e66f879d69af929c3dadfc1a8f31e.
    
    The purpose of the refactor was for amdgpu_crtc_prepare/submit_flip to
    be used by the DC code, but that's no longer the case.

    Make pflip atomic friendly. Split the fuinction into
    whatever can fail part and the actual flip submit part.
    Call the pre-submit function before atomic states
    are swapped so in case of error we can fail the
    IOCTL.

    Update due to  target_vblank code change.
    Fix identetation.

    drm: Don't include <drm/drm_encoder.h> in <drm/drm_crtc.h>
    
    <drm/drm_crtc.h> used to define most of the in-kernel KMS API. It has
    now been split into separate files for each object type, but still
    includes most other KMS headers to avoid breaking driver compilation.
    
    As a step towards fixing that problem, remove the inclusion of
    <drm/drm_encoder.h> from <drm/drm_crtc.h> and include it instead where
    appropriate. Also remove the forward declarations of the drm_encoder and
    drm_encoder_helper_funcs structures from <drm/drm_crtc.h> as they're not
    needed in the header.
    
    <drm/drm_encoder.h> now has to include <drm/drm_mode.h> and contain a
    forward declaration of struct drm_encoder in order to allow including it
    as the first header in a compilation unit.

    drm/amdgpu: Fixup hw vblank counter/ts for new drm_update_vblank_count() (v3)
    
    commit 4dfd6486 "drm: Use vblank timestamps to guesstimate how many
    vblanks were missed" introduced in Linux 4.4-rc1 makes the drm core
    more fragile to drivers which don't update hw vblank counters and
    vblank timestamps in sync with firing of the vblank irq and
    essentially at leading edge of vblank.
    
    This exposed a problem with radeon-kms/amdgpu-kms which do not
    satisfy above requirements:
    
    The vblank irq fires a few scanlines before start of vblank, but
    programmed pageflips complete at start of vblank and
    vblank timestamps update at start of vblank, whereas the
    hw vblank counter increments only later, at start of vsync.
    
    This leads to problems like off by one errors for vblank counter
    updates, vblank counters apparently going backwards or vblank
    timestamps apparently having time going backwards. The net result
    is stuttering of graphics in games, or little hangs, as well as
    total failure of timing sensitive applications.
    
    See bug #93147 for an example of the regression on Linux 4.4-rc:
    
    https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93147
    
    This patch tries to align all above events better from the
    viewpoint of the drm core / of external callers to fix the problem:
    
    1. The apparent start of vblank is shifted a few scanlines earlier,
    so the vblank irq now always happens after start of this extended
    vblank interval and thereby drm_update_vblank_count() always samples
    the updated vblank count and timestamp of the new vblank interval.
    
    To achieve this, the reporting of scanout positions by
    radeon_get_crtc_scanoutpos() now operates as if the vblank starts
    radeon_crtc->lb_vblank_lead_lines before the real start of the hw
    vblank interval. This means that the vblank timestamps which are based
    on these scanout positions will now update at this earlier start of
    vblank.
    
    2. The driver->get_vblank_counter() function will bump the returned
    vblank count as read from the hw by +1 if the query happens after
    the shifted earlier start of the vblank, but before the real hw increment
    at start of vsync, so the counter appears to increment at start of vblank
    in sync with the timestamp update.
    
    3. Calls from vblank irq-context and regular non-irq calls are now
    treated identical, always simulating the shifted vblank start, to
    avoid inconsistent results for queries happening from vblank irq vs.
    happening from drm_vblank_enable() or vblank_disable_fn().
    
    4. The radeon_flip_work_func will delay mmio programming a pageflip until
    the start of the real vblank iff it happens to execute inside the shifted
    earlier start of the vblank, so pageflips now also appear to execute at
    start of the shifted vblank, in sync with vblank counter and timestamp
    updates. This to avoid some races between updates of vblank count and
    timestamps that are used for swap scheduling and pageflip execution which
    could cause pageflips to execute before the scheduled target vblank.
    
    The lb_vblank_lead_lines "fudge" value is calculated as the size of
    the display controllers line buffer in scanlines for the given video
    mode: Vblank irq's are triggered by the line buffer logic when the line
    buffer refill for a video frame ends, ie. when the line buffer source read
    position enters the hw vblank. This means that a vblank irq could fire at
    most as many scanlines before the current reported scanout position of the
    crtc timing generator as the number of scanlines the line buffer can
    maximally hold for a given video mode.
    
    This patch has been successfully tested on a RV730 card with DCE-3 display
    engine and on a evergreen card with DCE-4 display engine, in single-display
    and dual-display configuration, with different video modes.
    
    A similar patch is needed for amdgpu-kms to fix the same problem.
    
    Limitations:
    
    - Maybe replace the udelay() in the flip_work_func() by a suitable
      usleep_range() for a bit better efficiency? Will try that.
    
    - Line buffer sizes in pixels are hard-coded on < DCE-4 to a value
      i just guessed to be high enough to work ok, lacking info on the true
      sizes atm.
    
    Probably fixes: fdo#93147

    (v2) Refine amdgpu_flip_work_func() for better efficiency.
    
         In amdgpu_flip_work_func, replace the busy waiting udelay(5)
         with event lock held by a more performance and energy efficient
         usleep_range() until at least predicted true start of hw vblank,
         with some slack for scheduler happiness. Release the event lock
         during waits to not delay other outputs in doing their stuff, as
         the waiting can last up to 200 usecs in some cases.

    drm/amdgpu/dce10: Use cursor_set2 hook for enabling / disabling the HW cursor
    
    The cursor_set2 hook provides the cursor hotspot position within the
    cursor image. When the hotspot position changes, we can adjust the cursor
    position such that the hotspot doesn't move on the screen. This prevents
    the cursor from appearing to intermittently jump around on the screen
    when the position of the hotspot within the cursor image changes.

commit 88e72717c2de4181d8a6de1b04315953ad2bebdf

    drm/irq: Use unsigned int pipe in public API
    
    This continues the pattern started in commit cc1ef118fc09 ("drm/irq:
    Make pipe unsigned and name consistent"). This is applied to the public
    APIs and driver callbacks, so pretty much all drivers need to be updated
    to match the new prototypes.

    drm: Stop using linedur_ns and pixeldur_ns for vblank timestamps
    
    linedur_ns, and especially pixeldur_ns are becoming rather inaccurate
    to be used for the vblank timestamp correction. With 4k@60 the pixel
    duration is already below 2ns, so the amount of error due to the
    truncation to nanoseconds is introducing quite a bit of error.
    
    We can avoid such problems if we instead calculate the timestamp
    delta_ns directly from the dislay timings, avoiding the use of
    these intermediate truncated values.
