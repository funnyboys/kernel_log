    drm/amd/display: update scaling filters
    
    Currently there is a minor error in scaling filter coefficients
    caused by truncation to fit the HW registers.This error accummulates
    with increased taps, but has gone unnoticed due to vast majority of
    scaling being done with only 4 taps.
    
    Scaling filters are now updated using HW team's filter generator
    which has quantization error minimization built in.
