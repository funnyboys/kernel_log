    drm/amd/display: Create new i2c resource
    
    [Why]
    I2C code did not match dc resource model and was generally
    unpleasant
    
    [How]
    Move code into new svelte dce_i2c files, replacing various i2c
    objects with two structs: dce_i2c_sw and dce_i2c_hw.  Fully split
    sw and hw code paths.  Remove all redundant declarations.  Use
    address lists to distinguish between versions.  Change dce80 code
    to newer register access macros.
