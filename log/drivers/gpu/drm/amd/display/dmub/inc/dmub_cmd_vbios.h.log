    drm/amd/display: Split DMUB cmd type into type/subtype
    
    [Why]
    Commands will be considered a stable ABI between driver and firmware.
    
    Commands are also split between DC commands, DAL feature commands,
    and VBIOS commands.
    
    Commands are currently not designated to a specific ID and the enum
    does not provide a stable ABI.
    
    We currently group all of these into a single command type of 8-bits.
    With the stable ABI consideration in mind it's not unreasonable to
    run out of command IDs.
    
    For cleaner separation and versioning split the commands into a main
    type and a subtype.
    
    [How]
    For commands where performance matters (like reg sequences) these
    are still considered main commands.
    
    Sub commands will be split by ownership/feature.
    
    Update existing command sequences to reflect new changes.
