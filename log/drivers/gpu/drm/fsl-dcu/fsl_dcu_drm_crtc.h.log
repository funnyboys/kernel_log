    drm/layerscape: Add Freescale DCU DRM driver
    
    This patch add support for Two Dimensional Animation and Compositing
    Engine (2D-ACE) on the Freescale SoCs.
    
    2D-ACE is a Freescale display controller. 2D-ACE describes
    the functionality of the module extremely well its name is a value
    that cannot be used as a token in programming languages.
    Instead the valid token "DCU" is used to tag the register names and
    function names.
    
    The Display Controller Unit (DCU) module is a system master that
    fetches graphics stored in internal or external memory and displays
    them on a TFT LCD panel. A wide range of panel sizes is supported
    and the timing of the interface signals is highly configurable.
    Graphics are read directly from memory and then blended in real-time,
    which allows for dynamic content creation with minimal CPU
    intervention.
    
    The features:
    (1) Full RGB888 output to TFT LCD panel.
    (2) Blending of each pixel using up to 4 source layers
    dependent
    on size of panel.
    (3) Each graphic layer can be placed with one pixel resolution
    in either axis.
    (4) Each graphic layer support RGB565 and RGB888 direct colors
    without alpha channel and BGRA8888 BGRA4444 ARGB1555 direct
    colors
    with an alpha channel and YUV422 format.
    (5) Each graphic layer support alpha blending with 8-bit
    resolution.
    This is a simplified version, only one primary plane, one
    framebuffer, one crtc, one connector and one encoder for TFT
    LCD panel.
