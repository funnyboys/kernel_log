    drm/pci: Deprecate drm_pci_init/exit completely
    
    The magic switching between proper pci driver and shadow-attach isn't
    useful anymore since there's no ums+kms drivers left. Let's split this
    up properly, calling pci_register_driver for kms drivers and renaming
    the shadow-attach init to drm_legacy_pci_init/exit.

    drm: Mark up legacy/dri1 drivers with DRM_LEGACY
    
    It's super confusing that new drivers need to be marked with
    DRIVER_MODESET when really it means DRIVER_MODERN. Much better to
    invert the meaning and rename it to something that's suitably
    off-putting.
    
    Since there's over 100 places using DRIVER_MODESET we need to roll out
    this change without a flag day.

    drm: add driver->set_busid() callback
    
    One step closer to dropping all the drm_bus_* code:
    Add a driver->set_busid() callback and make all drivers use the generic
    helpers. Nouveau is the only driver that uses two different bus-types with
    the same drm_driver. This is totally broken if both buses are available on
    the same machine (unlikely, but lets be safe). Therefore, we create two
    different drivers for each platform during module_init() and set the
    set_busid() callback respectively.

    drm: rip out drm_core_has_MTRR checks
    
    The new arch_phys_wc_add/del functions do the right thing both with
    and without MTRR support in the kernel. So we can drop these
    additional checks.
    
    David Herrmann suggest to also kill the DRIVER_USE_MTRR flag since
    it's now unused, which spurred me to do a bit a better audit of the
    affected drivers. David helped a lot in that. Quoting our mail

    Cool, thanks a lot for stitching together the list of drivers to look
    at. So for real KMS drivers it's the drives responsibility to add an
    mtrr if it needs one. nouvea, radeon, mgag200, i915 and vmwgfx do that
    already. Somehow the savage driver also ends up doing that, I have no
    idea why.
    
    Note that gma500 as a pure KMS driver doesn't need MTRR setup since
    the platforms that it supports all support PAT. So no MTRRs needed to
    get wc iomappings.
    
    The mtrr support in the drm core is all for legacy mappings of garts,
    framebuffers and registers. All legacy drivers set the USE_MTRR flag,
    so we're good there.
    
    All in all I think we can really just ditch this
    
    /endquote
    
    v2: Also kill DRIVER_USE_MTRR as suggested by David Herrmann
    
    v3: Rebase on top of David Herrmann's agp setup/cleanup changes.

    drm: remove FASYNC support
    
    So I've stumbled over drm_fasync and wondered what it does. Digging
    that up is quite a story.
    
    First I've had to read up on what this does and ended up being rather
    bewildered why peopled loved signals so much back in the days that
    they've created SIGIO just for that ...
    
    Then I wondered how this ever works, and what that strange "No-op."
    comment right above it should mean. After all calling the core fasync
    helper is pretty obviously not a noop. After reading through the
    kernels FASYNC implementation I've noticed that signals are only sent
    out to the processes attached with FASYNC by calling kill_fasync.
    
    No merged drm driver has ever done that.
    
    After more digging I've found out that the only driver that ever used
    this is the so called GAMMA driver. I've frankly never heard of such a
    gpu brand ever before. Now FASYNC seems to not have been the only bad
    thing with that driver, since Dave Airlie removed it from the drm
    driver with prejudice:
    
    commit 1430163b4bbf7b00367ea1066c1c5fe85dbeefed
    Author: Dave Airlie <airlied@linux.ie>
    Date:   Sun Aug 29 12:04:35 2004 +0000
    
        Drop GAMMA DRM from a great height ...
    
    Long story short, the drm fasync support seems to be doing absolutely
    nothing. And the only user of it was never merged into the upstream
    kernel. And we don't need any fops->fasync callback since the fcntl
    implementation in the kernel already implements the noop case
    correctly.
    
    So stop this particular cargo-cult and rip it all out.
    
    v2: Kill drm_fasync assignments in rcar (newly added) and imx drivers
    (somehow I've missed that one in staging). Also drop the reference in
    the drm DocBook. ARM compile-fail reported by Rob Clark.
    
    v3: Move the removal of dev->buf_asnyc assignment in drm_setup to this
    patch here.
    
    v4: Actually git add ... tsk.

    drm: don't use idr_remove_all()
    
    idr_destroy() can destroy idr by itself and idr_remove_all() is being
    deprecated.  Drop its usage.
    
    * drm_ctxbitmap_cleanup() was calling idr_remove_all() but forgetting
      idr_destroy() thus leaking all buffered free idr_layers.  Replace it
      with idr_destroy().

    drm: use drm_compat_ioctl for 32-bit apps
    
    Most of the DRM drivers appear to be missing the .compat_ioctl file
    operation entry necessary for 32-bit application compatibility.
    
    This patch  uses drm_compat_ioctl for all drivers which don't have
    their own, and which are using drm_ioctl for .unlocked_ioctl.
    
    This leaves drivers/gpu/drm/psb/psb_drv.c unchanged; it has a custom
    .unlocked_ioctl and will presumably need a custom .compat_ioctl as
    well.

    The filed object_idr of struct drm_sis_private was introduced with
    commit http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=commitdiff;h=6de8a748881f1cd9d795454da2b6db616d5ca3d7 .
    
    The idr_init(&dev->object_name_idr) is called instead of
    idr_init(&dev_priv->object_idr) by mistake, leaving object_idr
    uninitialized. Correct this.
    
    This patch was not tested because of lack of hardware.

    drm: move pci bus master enable into driver.
    
    The current enabling of bus mastering in the drm midlayer allows a large
    race condition under kexec. When a kexec'ed kernel re-enables bus mastering
    for the GPU, previously setup dma blocks may cause writes to random pieces
    of memory. On radeon the writeback mechanism can cause these sorts of issues.
    
    This patch doesn't fix the problem, but it moves the bus master enable under
    the individual drivers control so they can move enabling it until later in
    their load cycle and close the race.
    
    Fix for radeon kms driver will be in a follow-up patch.

    In sis_driver_load(), the only use of 'ret' is as the return value
    from the function, unfortunately it is never initialized, so the

    To fix that, remove the variable and just return 0 directly on success.

    drm: Make the per-driver file_operations struct const

    Date: Sun, 30 Oct 2011 19:06:07 -0700
    Subject: [PATCH] drm: Make the per-driver file_operations struct const
    
    The DRM layer keeps a copy of struct file_operations inside its
    big driver struct... which prevents it from being consistent and static.
    For consistency (and the general security objective of having such things
    static), it's desirable to get this fixed.
    
    This patch splits out the file_operations field to its own struct,
    which is then "static const", and just stick a pointer to this into
    the driver struct, making it more consistent with how the rest of the
    kernel does this.

    drm: use noop_llseek
    
    The drm device drivers currently allow seeking on the
    character device but never care about the actual
    file position.
    
    When we change the default llseek operation to be
    no_llseek, calling llseek on a drm device would
    return an error condition, which is an API change.
    
    Explicitly setting noop_llseek lets us keep the
    current API.

    drm: kill context_ctor callback
    
    It's not used by any driver. The destructor callback is unfortunately
    used by the via driver in a rather convoluted piece of code used
    to reimplement something resembling broken futexes. I didn't dare
    to touch this code. But at least kill the needless NULL assignemt
    in the sis driver.

    drm: convert drm_ioctl to unlocked_ioctl
    
    drm_ioctl is called with the Big Kernel Lock held,
    which shows up very high in statistics on vfs_ioctl.
    
    Moving the lock into the drm_ioctl function itself
    makes sure we blame the right subsystem and it gets
    us one step closer to eliminating the locked version
    of fops->ioctl.
    
    Since drm_ioctl does not require the lock itself,
    we only need to hold it while calling the specific
    handler. The 32 bit conversion handlers do not
    interact with any other code, so they don't need
    the BKL here either and can just call drm_ioctl.
    
    As a bonus, this cleans up all the other users
    of drm_ioctl which now no longer have to find
    the inode or call lock_kernel.
    
    [airlied: squashed the non-driver bits
    of the second patch in here, this provides
    the flag for drivers to use to select unlocked
    ioctls - but doesn't modify any drivers].

    drm: reorganise drm tree to be more future proof.
    
    With the coming of kernel based modesetting and the memory manager stuff,
    the everything in one directory approach was getting very ugly and
    starting to be unmanageable.
    
    This restructures the drm along the lines of other kernel components.
    
    It creates a drivers/gpu/drm directory and moves the hw drivers into
    subdirectores. It moves the includes into an include/drm, and
    sets up the unifdef for the userspace headers we should be exporting.
