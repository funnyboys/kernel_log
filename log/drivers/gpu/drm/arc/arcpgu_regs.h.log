    DRM: ARC: PGU: replace unsupported by HW RGB888 format by XRGB888

    drm: Add support of ARC PGU display controller
    
    ARC PGU could be found on some development boards from Synopsys.
    This is a simple byte streamer that reads data from a framebuffer
    and sends data to the single encoder.
