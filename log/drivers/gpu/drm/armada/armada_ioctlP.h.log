commit 96f60e37dc66091bde8d5de136ff6fda09f2d799
Author: Russell King <rmk+kernel@arm.linux.org.uk>
Date:   Wed Aug 15 13:59:49 2012 +0100

    DRM: Armada: Add Armada DRM driver
    
    This patch adds support for the pair of LCD controllers on the Marvell
    Armada 510 SoCs.  This driver supports:
    - multiple contiguous scanout buffers for video and graphics
    - shm backed cacheable buffer objects for X pixmaps for Vivante GPU
      acceleration
    - dual lcd0 and lcd1 crt operation
    - video overlay on each LCD crt via DRM planes
    - page flipping of the main scanout buffers
    - DRM prime for buffer export/import
    
    This driver is trivial to extend to other Armada SoCs.
    
    Included in this commit is the core driver with no output support; output
    support is platform and encoder driver dependent.
