    drm/radeon: introduce kernel modesetting for radeon hardware
    
    Add kernel modesetting support to radeon driver, use the ttm memory
    manager to manage memory and DRM/GEM to provide userspace API.
    In order to avoid backward compatibility issue and to allow clean
    design and code the radeon kernel modesetting use different code path
    than old radeon/drm driver.
    
    When kernel modesetting is enabled the IOCTL of radeon/drm
    driver are considered as invalid and an error message is printed
    in the log and they return failure.
    
    KMS enabled userspace will use new API to talk with the radeon/drm
    driver. The new API provide functions to create/destroy/share/mmap
    buffer object which are then managed by the kernel memory manager
    (here TTM). In order to submit command to the GPU the userspace
    provide a buffer holding the command stream, along this buffer
    userspace have to provide a list of buffer object used by the
    command stream. The kernel radeon driver will then place buffer
    in GPU accessible memory and will update command stream to reflect
    the position of the different buffers.
    
    The kernel will also perform security check on command stream
    provided by the user, we want to catch and forbid any illegal use
    of the GPU such as DMA into random system memory or into memory
    not owned by the process supplying the command stream. This part
    of the code is still incomplete and this why we propose that patch
    as a staging driver addition, future security might forbid current
    experimental userspace to run.
    
    This code support the following hardware : R1XX,R2XX,R3XX,R4XX,R5XX
    (radeon up to X1950). Works is underway to provide support for R6XX,
    R7XX and newer hardware (radeon from HD2XXX to HD4XXX).
