    drm/radeon/kms: Convert R100 to new init path (V2)
    
    New init path allow to simply asic initialization and make easier
    to trace what happen on each different asic. We are removing most
    callback. More cleanup should happen latter to remove even more
    callback. Also cleanup register specific to R100,RV200,RV250.
    Version 2 correct the placement on IGP of the VRAM inside GPU address
    space to match the stollen RAM placement of IGP.
