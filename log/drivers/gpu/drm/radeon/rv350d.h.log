    drm/radeon/kms: Convert RS400/RS480 to new init path & fix legacy VGA (V3)
    
    Also cleanup register specific to RS400/RS480. This patch also fix
    legacy VGA register used to disable VGA access we were programming
    wrong register. Now we should properly disable VGA on r100 up to
    rs400 asics. Note that RS400/RS480 resume is broken, it hangs the
    computer while reprogramming dynamic clock, doesn't work either
    without that patch. We need to spend more time investigating this
    issue. Version 2 of the patch remove dead code that was left
    commented out in the previous version. Version 3 correct the
    placement on IGP of the VRAM inside GPU address space to match the
    stollen RAM placement of IGP.
