commit d5b1a78a772f1e31a94f8babfa964152ec5e9aa5
Author: Eric Anholt <eric@anholt.net>
Date:   Mon Nov 30 12:13:37 2015 -0800

    drm/vc4: Add support for drawing 3D frames.
    
    The user submission is basically a pointer to a command list and a
    pointer to uniforms.  We copy those in to the kernel, validate and
    relocate them, and store the result in a GPU BO which we queue for
    execution.
    
    v2: Drop support for NV shader recs (not necessary for GL), simplify
        vc4_use_bo(), improve bin flush/semaphore checks, use __u32 style
        types.
