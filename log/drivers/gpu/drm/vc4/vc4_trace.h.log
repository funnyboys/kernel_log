commit ff58a15a502a900c35ff2f20182249b65719d6d7

    drm/vc4: Use correct path to trace include
    
    The header comment in include/trace/define_trace.h specifies that the
    TRACE_INCLUDE_PATH needs to be relative to the define_trace.h header
    rather than the trace file including it. Most instances get that wrong
    and work around it by adding the $(src) directory to the include path.
    
    While this works, it is preferable to refer to the correct path to the
    trace file in the first place and avoid any workaround.

commit d5b1a78a772f1e31a94f8babfa964152ec5e9aa5
Author: Eric Anholt <eric@anholt.net>

    drm/vc4: Add support for drawing 3D frames.
    
    The user submission is basically a pointer to a command list and a
    pointer to uniforms.  We copy those in to the kernel, validate and
    relocate them, and store the result in a GPU BO which we queue for
    execution.
    
    v2: Drop support for NV shader recs (not necessary for GL), simplify
        vc4_use_bo(), improve bin flush/semaphore checks, use __u32 style
        types.
