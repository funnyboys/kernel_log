commit b5561412975633049661436fb3764d96b945eed0
Author: Laurent Pinchart <laurent.pinchart@ideasonboard.com>
Date:   Fri Oct 13 17:59:05 2017 +0300

    drm: omapdrm: Deconstruct the omap_drv.h header.
    
    The number of function declarations in the omap_drv.h degrades
    readability. To fix it, create new header files for each part of the
    driver and move the related functions.
