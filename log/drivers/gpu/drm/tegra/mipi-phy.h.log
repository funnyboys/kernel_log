    drm/tegra: Add DSI support
    
    This commit adds support for both DSI outputs found on Tegra. Only very
    minimal functionality is implemented, so advanced features like ganged
    mode won't work.
    
    Due to the lack of other test hardware, some sections of the driver are
    hardcoded to work with Dalmore.
