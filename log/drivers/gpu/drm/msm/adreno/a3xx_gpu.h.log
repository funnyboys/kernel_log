    drm/msm/gpu: add ocmem init/cleanup functions
    
    The files a3xx_gpu.c and a4xx_gpu.c have ifdefs for the OCMEM support
    that was missing upstream. Add two new functions (adreno_gpu_ocmem_init
    and adreno_gpu_ocmem_cleanup) that removes some duplicated code.

    drm/msm: Remove uneeded platform dev members
    
    Commit eeb754746b14 ("drm/msm/gpu: use pm-runtime") adds a pointer
    for the GPU platform device to the msm_gpu struct so we can
    happily remove the same pointers from the individual GPU
    structs.

    drm/msm: add a330/apq8x74
    
    Add support for adreno 330.  Not too much different, just a few
    differences in initial configuration plus setting OCMEM base.
    Userspace support is already in upstream mesa.
    
    Note that the existing DT code is simply using the bindings from
    downstream android kernel, to simplify porting of this driver to
    existing devices.  These do not constitute any committed/stable
    DT ABI.  The addition of proper DT bindings will be a subsequent
    patch, at which point (as best as possible) I will try to support
    either upstream bindings or what is found in downstream android
    kernel, so that existing device DT files can be used.

    drm/msm: add a3xx gpu support
    
    Add initial support for a3xx 3d core.
    
    So far, with hardware that I've seen to date, we can have:
     + zero, one, or two z180 2d cores
     + a3xx or a2xx 3d core, which share a common CP (the firmware
       for the CP seems to implement some different PM4 packet types
       but the basics of cmdstream submission are the same)
    
    Which means that the eventual complete "class" hierarchy, once
    support for all past and present hw is in place, becomes:
     + msm_gpu
       + adreno_gpu
         + a3xx_gpu
         + a2xx_gpu
       + z180_gpu
    
    This commit splits out the parts that will eventually be common
    between a2xx/a3xx into adreno_gpu, and the parts that are even
    common to z180 into msm_gpu.
    
    Note that there is no cmdstream validation required.  All memory access
    from the GPU is via IOMMU/MMU.  So as long as you don't map silly things
    to the GPU, there isn't much damage that the GPU can do.
