    drm/msm/gpu: Add trace events for tracking GPU submissions
    
    Add trace events to track the progress of a GPU submission
    msm_gpu_submit occurs at the beginning of the submissions,
    msm_gpu_submit_flush happens when the submission is put on
    the ringbuffer and msm_submit_flush_retired is sent when
    the operation is retired.
    
    To make it easier to track the operations a unique sequence
    number is assigned to each submission and displayed in each
    event output so a human or a script can easily associate
    the events related to a specific submission.
