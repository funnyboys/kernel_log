    drm: convert .debugfs_init() hook to return void.
    
    As a result of commit 987d65d01356 (drm: debugfs: make
    drm_debugfs_create_files() never fail) and changes to various debugfs
    functions in drm/core and across various drivers, there is no need for
    the drm_driver.debugfs_init() hook to have a return value. Therefore,
    declare it as void.
    
    This also includes refactoring all users of the .debugfs_init() hook to
    return void across the subsystem.
    
    v2: include changes to the hook and drivers that use it in one patch to
    prevent driver breakage and enable individual successful compilation of
    this change.

commit 85eac4700ede7c583aab29ad6bdfe135f693c29b
Author: Noralf Trønnes <noralf@tronnes.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 7 21:49:22 2017 +0100

    drm/msm: Remove msm_debugfs_cleanup()
    
    Move the contents of msm_debugfs_cleanup() to msm_drm_uninit() to free
    up the drm_driver->debugfs_cleanup callback. Also remove the
    mdp_kms_funcs->debugfs_cleanup callback which has no users.
