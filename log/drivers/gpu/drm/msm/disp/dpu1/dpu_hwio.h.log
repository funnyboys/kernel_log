commit 25fdd5933e4c0f5fe2ea5cd59994f8ac5fbe90ef
Author: Jeykumar Sankaran <jsanka@codeaurora.org>

    drm/msm: Add SDM845 DPU support
    
    SDM845 SoC includes the Mobile Display Sub System (MDSS) which is a
    top level wrapper consisting of Display Processing Unit (DPU) and
    display peripheral modules such as Display Serial Interface (DSI)
    and DisplayPort (DP).
    
    MDSS functions essentially as a back-end composition engine. It blends
    video and graphic images stored in the frame buffers and scans out the
    composed image to a display sink (over DSI/DP).
    
    The following diagram represents hardware blocks for a simple pipeline
    (two planes are present on a given crtc which is connected to a DSI
    connector):
    
           MDSS

          +---------------------------------+
    
    The number of DPU sub-blocks (i.e. SSPPs, LMs, PP blocks and INTFs)
    depends on SoC capabilities.
    
    Overview of DPU sub-blocks:
    ---------------------------
    * Source Surface Processor (SSPP):
     Refers to any of hardware pipes like ViG, DMA etc. Only ViG pipes are
     capable of performing format conversion, scaling and quality improvement
     for source surfaces.
    
    * Layer Mixer (LM):
     Blend source surfaces together (in requested zorder)
    
    * PingPong (PP):
     This block controls frame done interrupt output, EOL and EOF generation,
     overflow/underflow control.
    
    * Display interface (INTF):
     Timing generator and interface connecting the display peripherals.
    
    DRM components mapping to DPU architecture:
    ------------------------------------------
    PLANEs maps to SSPPs
    CRTC maps to LMs
    Encoder maps to PPs, INTFs
    
    Data flow setup:
    ---------------
    MDSS hardware can support various data flows (e.g.):
      - Dual pipe: Output from two LMs combined to single display.
      - Split display: Output from two LMs connected to two separate
                       interfaces.
    
    The hardware capabilities determine the number of concurrent data paths
    possible. Any control path (i.e. pipeline w/i DPU) can be routed to any
    of the hardware data paths. A given control path can be triggered,
    flushed and controlled independently.
    
    Changes in v3:
    - Move msm_media_info.h from uapi to dpu/ subdir
    - Remove preclose callback dpu (it's handled in core)
    - Fix kbuild warnings with parent_ops
    - Remove unused functions from dpu_core_irq
    - Rename mdss_phys to mdss
    - Rename mdp_phys address space to mdp
    - Drop _phys from vbif and regdma binding names
