commit 14be3200cd5f4ccece246f969c9c3645c3c12bd3
Author: Rob Clark <robdclark@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Feb 12 08:18:27 2018 -0500

    drm/msm: rename mdp->disp
    
    Since new display controller is called "dpu" instead of "mdp".  Lets
    make the name of the toplevel directory for the display controllers a
    bit more generic.
