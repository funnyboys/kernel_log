commit 8f83f26891e12570780dcfc8ae376b655915ff6d

    drm/mediatek: Add HDMI support
    
    This patch adds drivers for the HDMI bridge connected to the DPI0
    display subsystem function block, for the HDMI DDC block, and for
    the HDMI PHY to support HDMI output.
    This includes an interface to the generic hdmi-codec driver to start
    or stop audio playback and to retrieve ELD (EDID like data) to limit the
    supported audio formats to the HDMI sink capabilities.
