    gpu/trace: add a gpu total memory usage tracepoint
    
    This change adds the below gpu memory tracepoint:
    gpu_mem/gpu_mem_total: track global or proc gpu memory total usages
    
    Per process tracking of total gpu memory usage in the gem layer is not
    appropriate and hard to implement with trivial overhead. So for the gfx
    device driver layer to track total gpu memory usage both globally and
    per process in an easy and uniform way is to integrate the tracepoint in
    this patch to the underlying varied implementations of gpu memory
    tracking system from vendors.
    
    Putting this tracepoint in the common trace events can not only help
    wean the gfx drivers off of debugfs but also greatly help the downstream
    Android gpu vendors because debugfs is to be deprecated in the upcoming
    Android release. Then the gpu memory tracking of both Android kernel and
    the upstream linux kernel can stay closely, which can benefit the whole
    kernel eco-system in the long term.
