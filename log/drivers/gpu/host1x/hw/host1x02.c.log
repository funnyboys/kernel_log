commit f1b53c4e2c08cbd805a2fdede0026edb30b59602
Author: Mikko Perttunen <mperttunen@nvidia.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 5 11:43:05 2017 +0300

    gpu: host1x: Add Tegra186 support
    
    Add support for the implementation of Host1x present on the Tegra186.
    The register space has been shuffled around a little bit, requiring
    addition of some chip-specific code sections. Tegra186 also adds
    several new features, most importantly the hypervisor, but those are
    not yet supported with this commit.

    gpu: host1x: Use the correct HW headers for host1x02
    
    An earlier patch added a subset of the required HW specific header files
    but didn't actually include the right ones when compiling for host1x02.
