commit ac1bdbf22bebabfee150bb5c33a02c4d0119d185

    gpu: host1x: Add Tegra194 support
    
    The host1x hardware found on Tegra194 is mostly backwards compatible
    with the version found on Tegra186, with the notable exceptions of the
    increased number of syncpoints and mlocks. In addition, some rarely
    used features such as syncpoint wait bases were dropped and some
    registers had to move around to accomodate the increased number of
    syncpoints.
