    usnic: add missing clauses to BSD license
    
    The usnic_verbs kernel module was clearly marked with the following in
    its code:
    
      MODULE_LICENSE("Dual BSD/GPL");
    
    However, we accidentally left a few clauses of the BSD text out of the
    license header in all the source files.  This commit fixes that: all
    the files are properly dual BSD/GPL-licensed.  Contributors that might
    have been confused by this have been contacted to get their permission
    and are Cc:ed here.

    IB/usnic: Add Cisco VIC low-level hardware driver
