    IB/rdmavt: Add support for tracing events
    
    This patch adds support of tracing events using the kernels built-in event
    tracing infrastructure. This can be extended to provide a wide range of
    trace and debug capabilities which have a negligible impact on performance
    when enabled. These should be preferred over the use of the rvt_pr*
    functions.
