    IB: Pass only ib_udata in function prototypes
    
    Now when ib_udata is passed to all the driver's object create/destroy APIs
    the ib_udata will carry the ib_ucontext for every user command. There is
    no need to also pass the ib_ucontext via the functions prototypes.
    
    Make ib_udata the only argument psssed.

    IB: Pass uverbs_attr_bundle down ib_x destroy path
    
    The uverbs_attr_bundle with the ucontext is sent down to the drivers ib_x
    destroy path as ib_udata. The next patch will use the ib_udata to free the
    drivers destroy path from the dependency in 'uobject->context' as we
    already did for the create path.

    RDMA: Handle PD allocations by IB/core
    
    The PD allocations in IB/core allows us to simplify drivers and their
    error flows in their .alloc_pd() paths. The changes in .alloc_pd() go hand
    in had with relevant update in .dealloc_pd().
    
    We will use this opportunity and convert .dealloc_pd() to don't fail, as
    it was suggested a long time ago, failures are not happening as we have
    never seen a WARN_ON print.
