commit a84ef0d181d917125f1f16cffe53f84c19968969
Author: Joachim Eastwood <manabian@gmail.com>

    iio: accel: add Freescale MMA7455L/MMA7456L 3-axis accelerometer driver
    
    Add support for Freescale MMA7455L/MMA7456L 3-axis in 10-bit mode for
    I2C and SPI bus. This rather simple driver that currently doesn't
    support all the hardware features of MMA7455L/MMA7456L.
    
    Tested on Embedded Artist's LPC4357 Dev Kit with MMA7455L on I2C bus.
    
    Data sheets for the two devices can be found here:
