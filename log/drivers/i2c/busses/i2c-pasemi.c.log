commit 5c18d12ced225fa0ad5a03fb42bbb293815d1342
Author: Darren Stevens <darren@stevens-zone.net>
Date:   Sun Dec 31 20:53:55 2017 +0000

    i2c: pasemi: remove hardcoded bus numbers on smbus
    
    The pasemi smbus controller uses PCI_FUNC(dev->devfn) to define which
    number bus to attach to, however this fails when something else is
    probed first, for example an ATI Radeon graphics card will claim 9 or
    10 busses, including the ones the pasemi wants.
    Patch the driver to call i2c_add_adapter rather than
    i2c_add_numbered_adapter.

    i2c: busses: make use of i2c_8bit_addr_from_msg
    
    Because it looks neater.
    
    For diolan, this allows factoring out some code that is now common
    between if and else.
    
    For eg20t, pch_i2c_writebytes is always called with a write in
    msgs->flags, and pch_i2c_readbytes with a read.
    
    For imx, i2c_imx_dma_write and i2c_imx_write are always called with a
    write in msgs->flags, and i2c_imx_read with a read.
    
    For qup, qup_i2c_write_tx_fifo_v1 is always called with a write in
    qup->msg->flags.
    
    For stu300, also restructure debug output for resends, since that
    code as a result is only handling debug output.

    i2c/i2c-pasemi.c: Fix unsigned return type
    
    The function has an unsigned return type, but returns a negative constant
    to indicate an error condition.  The result of calling the function is
    always stored in a variable of type (signed) int, and thus unsigned can be
    dropped from the return type.
    
    A sematic match that finds this problem is as follows:

commit 5a0e3ad6af8660be21ca98a971cd00f331318c05
Author: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 24 17:04:11 2010 +0900

    include cleanup: Update gfp.h and slab.h includes to prepare for breaking implicit slab.h inclusion from percpu.h
    
    percpu.h is included by sched.h and module.h and thus ends up being
    included when building most .c files.  percpu.h includes slab.h which
    in turn includes gfp.h making everything defined by the two files
    universally available and complicating inclusion dependencies.
    
    percpu.h -> slab.h dependency is about to be removed.  Prepare for
    this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those
    headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion
    needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is
    used as the basis of conversion.
    
      http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py
    
    The script does the followings.
    
    * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that
      only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,
      gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.
    
    * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include
      blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms
      to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains
      core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -
      alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there
      doesn't seem to be any matching order.
    
    * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly
      because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out
      an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the
      file.
    
    The conversion was done in the following steps.
    
    1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly
       over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h
       and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400
       files.
    
    2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,
       some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or
       embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added
       inclusions to around 150 files.
    
    3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits
       from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.
    
    4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.
       e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab
       APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.
    
    5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically
       editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h
       files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h
       inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually
       wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each
       slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as
       necessary.
    
    6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.
    
    7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures
       were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my
       distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few
       more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things
       build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).
    
       * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.
       * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig
       * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig
       * ia64 SMP allmodconfig
       * s390 SMP allmodconfig
       * alpha SMP allmodconfig
       * um on x86_64 SMP allmodconfig
    
    8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as
       a separate patch and serve as bisection point.
    
    Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step
    6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch.
    If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch
    headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of
    the specific arch.

    i2c: Make PCI device ids constant
    
    The id_table field of the struct pci_driver is constant in <linux/pci.h>
    so it is worth to make initialization data also constant.
    
    The semantic match that finds this kind of pattern is as follows:

    i2c: Let bus drivers add SPD to their class
    
    Let general purpose I2C/SMBus bus drivers add SPD to their class. Once
    this is done, we will be able to tell the eeprom driver to only probe
    for SPD EEPROMs and similar on these buses.
    
    Note that I took a conservative approach here, adding I2C_CLASS_SPD to
    many drivers that have no idea whether they can host SPD EEPROMs or not.
    This is to make sure that the eeprom driver doesn't stop probing buses
    where SPD EEPROMs or equivalent live.
    
    So, bus driver maintainers and users should feel free to remove the SPD
    class from drivers those buses never have SPD EEPROMs or they don't
    want the eeprom driver to bind to them. Likewise, feel free to add the
    SPD class to any bus driver I might have missed.

    i2c-pasemi: use i2c_add_numbered_adapter()
    
    Use numbered adapter registration to always have the same hardware bus
    show up at the same number.
    
    PWRficient 1682M has three buses, they are all on the same PCI device but
    different functions. So do the simple thing and register them based on
    function number. Future products, if having a different number of busses,
    are expected to have similar behaviour w.r.t. device/function layout.

    i2c-pasemi: Fix NACK detection
    
    Turns out we don't actually check the status to see if there was a
    device out there to talk to, just if we had a timeout when doing so.
    
    Add the proper check, so we don't falsly think there are devices
    on the bus that are not there, etc.

    i2c: Shrink struct i2c_client
    
    This shrinks the size of "struct i2c_client" by 40 bytes:
    
     - Substantially shrinks the string used to identify the chip type
     - The "flags" don't need to be so big
     - Removes some internal padding
    
    It also adds kerneldoc for that struct, explaining how "name" is really a
    chip type identifier; it's otherwise potentially confusing.
    
    Because the I2C_NAME_SIZE symbol was abused for both i2c_client.name
    and for i2c_adapter.name, this needed to affect i2c_adapter too.  The
    adapters which used that symbol now use the more-obviously-correct
    idiom of taking the size of that field.
    
    JD: Shorten i2c_adapter.name from 50 to 48 bytes while we're here, to
    avoid wasting space in padding.

    * Last write during i2c_xfer is of the wrong byte (off-by-1).
    * Read length is wrong for some of the reads (mistakenly used the PEC
