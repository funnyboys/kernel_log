    i2c: acpi: Drop double check for ACPI companion device
    
    acpi_dev_get_resources() does perform the NULL pointer check against
    ACPI companion device which is given as function parameter. Thus,
    there is no need to duplicate this check in the caller.

    i2c: core: Provide generic definitions for bus frequencies
    
    There are few maximum bus frequencies being used in the I²C core code.
    Provide generic definitions for bus frequencies and use them in the core.
    
    The drivers may use predefined constants where it is appropriate.
    Some of them are already using these under slightly different names.
    We will convert them later to use newly introduced defines.
    
    Note, the name of modes are chosen to follow well established naming
    scheme [1].
    
    These definitions will also help to avoid typos in the numbers that
    may lead to subtle errors.

commit 7574c0db2e68c4d0bae9d415a683bdd8b2a761e9
Author: Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>

    i2c: acpi: Force bus speed to 400KHz if a Silead touchscreen is present
    
    Many cheap devices use Silead touchscreen controllers. Testing has shown
    repeatedly that these touchscreen controllers work fine at 400KHz, but for
    unknown reasons do not work properly at 100KHz. This has been seen on
    both ARM and x86 devices using totally different i2c controllers.
    
    On some devices the ACPI tables list another device at the same I2C-bus
    as only being capable of 100KHz, testing has shown that these other
    devices work fine at 400KHz (as can be expected of any recent I2C hw).
    
    This commit makes i2c_acpi_find_bus_speed() always return 400KHz if a
    Silead touchscreen controller is present, fixing the touchscreen not
    working on devices which ACPI tables' wrongly list another device on the
    same bus as only being capable of 100KHz.
    
    Specifically this fixes the touchscreen on the Jumper EZpad 6 m4 not
    working.

    Pull driver core updates from Greg Kroah-Hartman:
     "Here is the big driver core update for 5.4-rc1.
    
      There was a bit of a churn in here, with a number of core and OF
      platform patches being added to the tree, and then after much
      discussion and review and a day-long in-person meeting, they were
      decided to be reverted and a new set of patches is currently being
      reviewed on the mailing list.
    
      Other than that churn, there are two "persistent" branches in here
      that other trees will be pulling in as well during the merge window.
      One branch to add support for drivers to have the driver core
      automatically add sysfs attribute files when a driver is bound to a
      device so that the driver doesn't have to manually do it (and then
      clean it up, as it always gets it wrong).
    
      There's another branch in here for generic lookup helpers for the
      driver core that lots of busses are starting to use. That's the
      majority of the non-driver-core changes in this patch series.
    
      There's also some on-going debugfs file creation cleanup that has been
      slowly happening over the past few releases, with the goal to
      hopefully get that done sometime next year.
    
      All of these have been in linux-next for a while now with no reported
      issues"
    
    [ Note that the above-mentioned generic lookup helpers branch was
      already brought in by the LED merge (commit 4feaab05dc1e) that had
      shared it.
    
      Also note that that common branch introduced an i2c bug due to a bad
      conversion, which got fixed here. - Linus ]

    Pull LED updates from Jacek Anaszewski:
     "In this cycle we've finally managed to contribute the patch set
      sorting out LED naming issues. Besides that there are many changes
      scattered among various LED class drivers and triggers.
    
      LED naming related improvements:
    
       - add new 'function' and 'color' fwnode properties and deprecate
         'label' property which has been frequently abused for conveying
         vendor specific names that have been available in sysfs anyway
    
       - introduce a set of standard LED_FUNCTION* definitions
    
       - introduce a set of standard LED_COLOR_ID* definitions
    
       - add a new {devm_}led_classdev_register_ext() API with the
         capability of automatic LED name composition basing on the
         properties available in the passed fwnode; the function is
         backwards compatible in a sense that it uses 'label' data, if
         present in the fwnode, for creating LED name
    
       - add tools/leds/get_led_device_info.sh script for retrieving LED
         vendor, product and bus names, if applicable; it also performs
         basic validation of an LED name
    
       - update following drivers and their DT bindings to use the new LED
         registration API:
    
            - leds-an30259a, leds-gpio, leds-as3645a, leds-aat1290, leds-cr0014114,
              leds-lm3601x, leds-lm3692x, leds-lp8860, leds-lt3593, leds-sc27xx-blt
    
      Other LED class improvements:
    
       - replace {devm_}led_classdev_register() macros with inlines
    
       - allow to call led_classdev_unregister() unconditionally
    
       - switch to use fwnode instead of be stuck with OF one
    
      LED triggers improvements:
    
       - led-triggers:
            - fix dereferencing of null pointer
            - fix a memory leak bug
    
       - ledtrig-gpio:
            - GPIO 0 is valid
    
      Drop superseeded apu2/3 support from leds-apu since for apu2+ a newer,
      more complete driver exists, based on a generic driver for the AMD
      SOCs gpio-controller, supporting LEDs as well other devices:
    
       - drop profile field from priv data
    
       - drop iosize field from priv data
    
       - drop enum_apu_led_platform_types
    
       - drop superseeded apu2/3 led support
    
       - add pr_fmt prefix for better log output
    
       - fix error message on probing failure
    
      Other misc fixes and improvements to existing LED class drivers:
    
       - leds-ns2, leds-max77650:
            - add of_node_put() before return
    
       - leds-pwm, leds-is31fl32xx:

       - leds-lm3697, leds-lm36274, leds-lm3532:

            - change the define for the fs current register

            - fix optional led-max-microamp prop error handling

      Other than the debugfs cleanups, in this set of changes we have:
    
       - bus iteration function cleanups
    
       - scripts/get_abi.pl tool to display and parse Documentation/ABI
         entries in a simple way

       - driver model documentation file conversions to .rst

    Bring the ACPI path in sync with the device tree path and handle all the
    IRQ fetching at probe time. This leaves the only IRQ handling at device
    registration time being that which is passed directly through the board
    info as either a resource or an actual IRQ number.

    i2c: acpi: Factor out getting the IRQ from ACPI
    
    In preparation for future refactoring factor out the fetch of the IRQ
    into its own helper function. Whilst we are at it update the handling
    to return the actual error code returned from acpi_dev_get_resources
    as well.

    bus_find_device: Unify the match callback with class_find_device
    
    There is an arbitrary difference between the prototypes of
    bus_find_device() and class_find_device() preventing their callers
    from passing the same pair of data and match() arguments to both of
    them, which is the const qualifier used in the prototype of
    class_find_device().  If that qualifier is also used in the
    bus_find_device() prototype, it will be possible to pass the same
    match() callback function to both bus_find_device() and
    class_find_device(), which will allow some optimizations to be made in
    order to avoid code duplication going forward.  Also with that, constify
    the "data" parameter as it is passed as a const to the match function.
    
    For this reason, change the prototype of bus_find_device() to match
    the prototype of class_find_device() and adjust its callers to use the
    const qualifier in accordance with the new prototype of it.

commit 4befedc045367c359de8ba021120fcf3bf797992
Author: Ard Biesheuvel <ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org>
Date:   Fri May 24 18:26:46 2019 +0200

    i2c: acpi: permit bus speed to be discovered after enumeration
    
    Currently, the I2C ACPI enumeration code only permits the max bus rate
    to be discovered before enumerating the slaves on the bus. In some
    cases, drivers for slave devices may require this information, e.g.,
    some ATmel crypto drivers need to generate a so-called wake token
    of a fixed duration, regardless of the bus rate.
    
    So tweak the code so i2c_acpi_lookup_speed() is able to obtain this
    information after enumeration as well.

    i2c: acpi: Return error pointers from i2c_acpi_new_device()
    
    The caller would like to know the reason why the i2c_acpi_new_device() fails.
    For example, if adapter is not available, it might be in the future and we
    would like to re-probe the clients again. But at the same time we would like to
    bail out if the error seems unrecoverable, such as invalid argument supplied.
    To achieve this, return error pointer in some cases.

    i2c: core: ACPI: Make acpi_gsb_i2c_read_bytes() check i2c_transfer return value
    
    Currently acpi_gsb_i2c_read_bytes() directly returns i2c_transfer's return
    value. i2c_transfer returns a value < 0 on error and 2 (for 2 successfully
    executed transfers) on success. But the ACPI code expects 0 on success, so
    currently acpi_gsb_i2c_read_bytes()'s caller does:
    
            if (status > 0)
                    status = 0;
    
    This commit makes acpi_gsb_i2c_read_bytes() return a value which can be
    directly consumed by the ACPI code, mirroring acpi_gsb_i2c_write_bytes(),
    this commit also makes acpi_gsb_i2c_read_bytes() explitcly check that
    i2c_transfer returns 2, rather then accepting any value > 0.

    i2c: core: ACPI: Properly set status byte to 0 for multi-byte writes
    
    acpi_gsb_i2c_write_bytes() returns i2c_transfer()'s return value, which
    is the number of transfers executed on success, so 1.
    
    The ACPI code expects us to store 0 in gsb->status for success, not 1.
    
    Specifically this breaks the following code in the Thinkpad 8 DSDT:
    
                ECWR = I2CW = ECWR /* \_SB_.I2C1.BAT0.ECWR */
                If ((ECST == Zero))
                {
                    ECRD = I2CR /* \_SB_.I2C1.I2CR */
                }
    
    Before this commit we set ECST to 1, causing the read to never happen
    breaking battery monitoring on the Thinkpad 8.
    
    This commit makes acpi_gsb_i2c_write_bytes() return 0 when i2c_transfer()
    returns 1, so the single write transfer completed successfully, and
    makes it return -EIO on for other (unexpected) return values >= 0.

    i2c: core: ACPI: Log device not acking errors at dbg loglevel
    
    Unfortunately some DSDTs issue bogus i2c reads to non existing devices
    resulting in -EREMOTEIO errors because the non existing device of course
    does not ack.
    
    This happens e.g. from the The Asus T100TA's _BIX method, the DSDT on
    the T100TA defines 2 resources on the I2C1 bus:
    
            Name (EHID, ResourceTemplate ()
            {
                I2cSerialBusV2 (0x005B, ControllerInitiated, 0x00061A80,
                    AddressingMode7Bit, "\\_SB.I2C1",
                    0x00, ResourceConsumer, , Exclusive,
                    )
            })
            OperationRegion (EHOR, GenericSerialBus, Zero, 0x0100)
            Field (EHOR, BufferAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
            {
                Connection (EHID),
                Offset (0x01),
                AccessAs (BufferAcc, AttribBytes (0x10)),
                ABCD,   8
            }
    
            Name (UMPC, ResourceTemplate ()
            {
                I2cSerialBusV2 (0x0066, ControllerInitiated, 0x00061A80,
                    AddressingMode7Bit, "\\_SB.I2C1",
                    0x00, ResourceConsumer, , Exclusive,
                    )
            })
    
    The _BIX method does a single read (on each BIX() call) from the EHID
    device through the ABCD Field, only to completely ignore the result.
    This read always fails as there is no i2c client at address 0x5b.
    
    The _BIX method also does several reads from the UMPC device and actually
    uses the results of those to provide battery information.
    
    IIRC I've also seen some DSTDs which do an i2c read to detect if a device
    is present, also leading to false positive errors being logged.
    
    Esp. the _BIX use is problematic as the _BIX method gets called
    periodically to monitor battery status.
    
    This commit stops the logs from filling up with errors like these:

    i2c: core: Allow empty id_table in ACPI case as well
    
    For now empty ID table is not allowed with ACPI and prevents driver to
    be probed.
    
    Add a check to allow empty ID table.
    
    This introduces a helper i2c_acpi_match_device().
    
    Note, we rename some static function in i2c-core-acpi.c to distinguish
    with public API.

    i2c: acpi: Do not create i2c-clients for LNXVIDEO ACPI devices
    
    ACPI video devices get tagged by the kernel with the custom LNXVIDEO
    HID so that normal pnp-id matching can be used and are handled by the
    acpi-video driver.
    
    Sometimes the ACPI nodes describing these contain a SERIAL_TYPE_I2C ACPI
    resource. Before this commit the presence of this resource would cause the
    i2c-core to create a /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-LNXVIDEO:00 device for this
    with a modalias of: "i2c:LNXVIDEO:00".
    
    There is no i2c driver for this custom HID, the acpi-video driver binds
    directly to the ACPI device /sys/bus/acpi/devices/LNXVIDEO\:00 which has
    a modalias of "acpi:LNXVIDEO:" .
    
    Not only is the creation of an i2c-client for this undesirable, it is
    actually causing problems. This weird pseudo-resource claims an i2c
    speed of 100KHz and typically points to the i2c bus which is used by the
    touchscreen controller. Some touchscreen controllers only work properly at
    400KHz, at 100KHz they cause errors like these:
    
    i2c_designware 80860F41:03: i2c_dw_handle_tx_abort: lost arbitration
    i2c_designware 80860F41:03: i2c_dw_handle_tx_abort: lost arbitration
    i2c_designware 80860F41:03: i2c_dw_handle_tx_abort: lost arbitration
    i2c_designware 80860F41:03: i2c_dw_handle_tx_abort: lost arbitration
    silead_ts i2c-MSSL1680:00: Registers clear error -11
    
    This commit makes the i2c-core ignore LNXVIDEO compatible ACPI devices
    which has 2 positive results:
    
    1) The bogus i2c-client for these is no longer created.
    2) i2c_acpi_lookup_speed now ignores the 100KHz speed from the pseudo
    i2c-resouce and properly returns 400KHz as speed for the touchscreen
    i2c bus, fixing the touchscreen not working on various devies.
