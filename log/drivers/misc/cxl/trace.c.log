commit 9bcf28cdb28e6a793c4e59f0a42c66fe241993a8
Author: Ian Munsie <imunsie@au1.ibm.com>
Date:   Fri Jan 9 20:34:36 2015 +1100

    cxl: Add tracepoints
    
    This patch adds tracepoints throughout the cxl driver, which can provide
    insight into:
    
    - Context lifetimes
    - Commands sent to the PSL and AFU and their completion status
    - Segment and page table misses and their resolution
    - PSL and AFU interrupts
    - slbia calls from the powerpc copro_fault code
    
    These tracepoints are mostly intended to aid in debugging (particularly
    for new AFU designs), and may be useful standalone or in conjunction
    with hardware traces collected by the PSL (read out via the trace
    interface in debugfs) and AFUs.
