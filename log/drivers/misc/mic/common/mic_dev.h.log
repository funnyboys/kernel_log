    misc: mic: Remove COSM functionality from the MIC card driver
    
    Since card side COSM functionality, to trigger MIC device shutdowns
    and communicate shutdown status to the host, is now moved into a
    separate COSM client driver, this patch removes this functionality
    from the base MIC card driver. The mic_bus driver is also updated to
    use the device index provided by COSM rather than maintain its own
    device index.
