    Intel MIC Host Driver Interrupt/SMPT support.
    
    This patch enables the following features:
    a) MSIx, MSI and legacy interrupt support.
    b) System Memory Page Table(SMPT) support. SMPT enables system memory
       access from the card. On X100 devices the host can program 32 SMPT
       registers each capable of accessing 16GB of system memory
       address space from X100 devices. The registers can thereby be used
       to access a cumulative 512GB of system memory address space from
       X100 devices at any point in time.
