    Intel MIC Card Driver for X100 family.
    
    This patch does the following:
    a) Initializes the Intel MIC X100 platform device and driver.
    b) Sets up support to handle shutdown requests from the host.
    c) Maps the device page after obtaining the device page address
    from the scratchpad registers updated by the host.
    d) Informs the host upon a card crash by registering a panic notifier.
    e) Informs the host upon a poweroff/halt event.
