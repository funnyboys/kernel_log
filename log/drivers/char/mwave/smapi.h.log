    char/mwave: remove custom BOOLEAN type
    
    The mwave driver has its own macros for the BOOLEAN type and the
    TRUE/FALSE values. This is redundant because the kernel already
    has bool/true/false, and it clashes with the ACPI headers that
    also define these types. The linux/acpi.h header is now included
    implicitly from mwave through the mc146818rtc.h header, as
    reported by Stephen Rothwell:
    
    In file included from drivers/char/mwave/smapi.c:51:0:
    drivers/char/mwave/smapi.h:52:0: warning: "TRUE" redefined
     #define TRUE 1
     ^
    In file included from include/acpi/acpi.h:58:0,
                     from include/linux/acpi.h:33,
                     from include/linux/mc146818rtc.h:21,
                     from drivers/char/mwave/smapi.c:50:
    include/acpi/actypes.h:438:0: note: this is the location of the previous definition
     #define TRUE                            (1 == 1)
     ^
    
    This removes the private types from mwave and uses the standard
    types instead.

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
