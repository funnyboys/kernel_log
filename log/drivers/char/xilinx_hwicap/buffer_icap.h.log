    xilinx_hwicap: remove improper wording in license statement
    
    GPLv2 doesn't allow additional restrictions to be imposed on any
    code, so this wording needs to be removed from these files.

    [POWERPC] Xilinx: hwicap: Refactor status handling code.
    
    Both the buffer-based and fifo-based icap cores have a status
    register.  Previously, this was only used internally to check whether
    transactions have completed.  However, the status can be useful to the
    main driver as well.  This patch exposes these status functions to the
    main driver along with some masks for the differnet bits.

    [POWERPC] Xilinx: hwicap driver
    
    This includes code for new fifo-based xps_hwicap in addition to the
    older opb_hwicap, which has a significantly different interface.  The
    common code between the two drivers is largely shared.
    
    Significant differences exists between this driver and what is
    supported in the EDK drivers.  In particular, most of the
    architecture-specific code for reconfiguring individual FPGA resources
    has been removed.  This functionality is likely better provided in a
    user-space support library.  In addition, read and write access is
    supported.  In addition, although the xps_hwicap cores support
    interrupt-driver mode, this driver only supports polled operation, in
    order to make the code simpler, and since the interrupt processing
    overhead is likely to slow down the throughput under Linux.
