    video: fbdev: atyfb: modify the static fb_ops directly
    
    Avoid modifying the fb_ops via info->fbops to let us make the pointer
    const in the future.

    mach64: optimize wait_for_fifo
    
    This is a simple optimization for fifo waiting that improves scrolling
    performance by 5%. If the queue has more free entries that what we
    consume, we can skip the costly register read next time.

    mach64: detect the dot clock divider correctly on sparc
    
    On Sun Ultra 5, it happens that the dot clock is not set up properly for
    some videomodes. For example, if we set the videomode "r1024x768x60" in
    the firmware, Linux would incorrectly set a videomode with refresh rate
    180Hz when booting (suprisingly, my LCD monitor can display it, although
    display quality is very low).
    
    The reason is this: Older mach64 cards set the divider in the register
    VCLK_POST_DIV. The register has four 2-bit fields (the field that is
    actually used is specified in the lowest two bits of the register
    CLOCK_CNTL). The 2 bits select divider "1, 2, 4, 8". On newer mach64 cards,
    there's another bit added - the top four bits of PLL_EXT_CNTL extend the
    divider selection, so we have possible dividers "1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 5, 6, 12".
    The Linux driver clears the top four bits of PLL_EXT_CNTL and never sets
    them, so it can work regardless if the card supports them. However, the
    sparc64 firmware may set these extended dividers during boot - and the
    mach64 driver detects incorrect dot clock in this case.
    
    This patch makes the driver read the additional divider bit from
    PLL_EXT_CNTL and calculate the initial refresh rate properly.

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    drivers/video/fbdev/atyfb: Use arch_phys_wc_add() and ioremap_wc()
    
    This driver uses strong UC for the MMIO region, and ioremap_wc()
    for the framebuffer to whitelist for the WC MTRR that can be
    changed to WC. On PAT systems we don't need the MTRR call so
    just use arch_phys_wc_add() there, this lets us remove all those
    ifdefs. Let's also be consistent and use ioremap_wc() for ATARI
    as well.
    
    There are a few motivations for this:
    
      a) Take advantage of PAT when available.
    
      b) Help bury MTRR code away, MTRR is architecture specific and
         on x86 it is being replaced by PAT.
    
      c) Help with the goal of eventually using _PAGE_CACHE_UC over
         _PAGE_CACHE_UC_MINUS on x86 on ioremap_nocache() (see commit
         de33c442e titled "x86 PAT: fix performance drop for glx,
         use UC minus for ioremap(), ioremap_nocache() and
         pci_mmap_page_range()").
    
    The conversion done is expressed by the following Coccinelle
    SmPL patch, it additionally required manual intervention to
    address all the ifdeffery and removal of redundant things which
    arch_phys_wc_add() already addresses such as verbose message
    about when MTRR fails and doing nothing when we didn't get an

    drivers/video/fbdev/atyfb: Replace MTRR UC hole with strong UC
    
    Replace a WC MTRR call followed by a UC MTRR "hole" call with a
    single WC MTRR call and use strong UC to protect the MMIO region
    and account for the device's architecture and MTRR size
    requirements.
    
    The atyfb driver relies on two overlapping MTRRs. It does this
    to account for the fact that, on some devices, it has the MMIO
    region bundled together with the framebuffer on the same PCI BAR
    and the hardware requirement on MTRRs on both base and size to
    be powers of two.
    
    In the worst case, the PCI BAR is of 16 MiB while the MMIO
    region is on the last 4 KiB of the same PCI BAR. If we use just
    one MTRR for WC, we can only end up with an 8 MiB or 16 MiB
    framebuffer. Using a 16 MiB WC framebuffer area is unacceptable
    since we need the MMIO region to not be write-combined. An 8 MiB
    WC framebuffer option does not let use quite a bit of
    framebuffer space, it would reduce the resolution capability of
    the device considerably.
    
    An alternative is to use many MTRRs but on some systems that
    could mean not having enough MTRRs to cover the framebuffer. The
    current solution is to issue a 16 MiB WC MTRR followed by a 4
    KiB UC MTRR on the last 4 KiB. Its worth mentioning and
    documenting that the current ioremap*() strategy as well: the
    first ioremap() is used only for the MMIO region, a second
    ioremap() call is used for the framebuffer *and* the MMIO
    region, the MMIO region then ends up mmapped twice.
    
    Two ioremap() calls are used since in some situations the
    framebuffer actually ends up on a separate auxiliary PCI BAR,
    but this is not always true. In the worst case, the PCI BAR is
    shared for both MMIO and the framebuffer. By allowing
    overlapping ioremap() calls, the driver enables two types of
    devices with one simple ioremap() strategy.
    
    See also:
    
      2f9e897353fc ("x86/mm/mtrr, pat: Document Write Combining MTRR type effects on PAT / non-PAT pages")
    
    By default, Linux today defaults both pci_mmap_page_range() and
    ioremap_nocache() to use _PAGE_CACHE_MODE_UC_MINUS. On x86,
    ioremap() aliases ioremap_nocache(). The preferred value for
    Linux may soon change, however, the goal is to use
    _PAGE_CACHE_MODE_UC by default in the future.
    
    We can use ioremap_uc() to set PCD=1, PWT=1 on non-PAT systems
    and use a PAT value of UC for PAT systems. This will ensure the
    same settings are in place regardless of what Linux decides to
    use by default later and to not regress our MTRR strategy since
    the effective memory type will differ depending on the value
    used. Using a WC MTRR on such an area will be nullified. This
    technique can be used to protect the MMIO region in this
    driver's case and address the restrictions of the device's
    architecture as well as restrictions set upon us by powers of 2
    when using MTRRs.
    
    This allows us to replace the two MTRR calls with a single 16
    MiB WC MTRR and use page-attribute settings for non-PAT and PAT
    entry values for PAT systems to ensure the appropriate effective
    memory type won't have a write-combining effect on the MMIO
    region on both non-PAT and PAT systems. The framebuffer area
    will be sure to get the write-combined effective memory type by
    white-listing it with ioremap_wc().
    
    We ensure the desired effective memory types are set by:
    
    0) Using one ioremap_uc() for the MMIO region alone.
       This will set the page attribute settings for the MMIO
       region to PCD=1, PWT=1 for non-PAT systems while using a
       strong UC value on PAT systems.
    
    1) Fixing the framebuffer ioremapped area to exclude the
       MMIO region and using ioremap_wc() instead to whitelist
       the area we want for write-combining.
    
    In both cases, an implementation defined (as per 2f9e897353fc)
    effective memory type of WC is used for the framebuffer for
    non-PAT systems.

commit f7018c21350204c4cf628462f229d44d03545254
Author: Tomi Valkeinen <tomi.valkeinen@ti.com>

    video: move fbdev to drivers/video/fbdev
    
    The drivers/video directory is a mess. It contains generic video related
    files, directories for backlight, console, linux logo, lots of fbdev
    device drivers, fbdev framework files.
    
    Make some order into the chaos by creating drivers/video/fbdev
    directory, and move all fbdev related files there.
    
    No functionality is changed, although I guess it is possible that some
    subtle Makefile build order related issue could be created by this
    patch.
