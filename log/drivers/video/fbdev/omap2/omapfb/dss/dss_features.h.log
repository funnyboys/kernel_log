commit f76ee892a99e68b55402b8d4b8aeffcae2aff34d
Author: Tomi Valkeinen <tomi.valkeinen@ti.com>

    omapfb: copy omapdss & displays for omapfb
    
    This patch makes a copy of the omapdss driver and the omap panel &
    encoder drivers for omapfb. The purpose is to separate omapdrm and
    omapfb drivers from each other.
    
    Note that this patch only does a direct copy of the files without any
    other modifications. The files are not yet used.
    
    The original files are in:
    
    drivers/video/fbdev/omap2/dss/
    drivers/video/fbdev/omap2/displays-new/
    
    Here's a more detailed explanation about this and the following patches,
    from the introduction mail of the patch series:
    
    A short background on the current status. We have the following
    entities:
    
    * omapdss, located in drivers/video/fbdev/omap2/dss/. This is a driver for the
      display subsystem IPs used on OMAP (and related) SoCs. It offers only a
      kernel internal API, and does not implement anything for fbdev or drm.
    
    * omapdss panels and encoders, located in
      drivers/video/fbdev/omap2/displays-new/. These are panel and external encoder
      drivers, which use APIs offered by omapdss driver. These also don't implement
      anything for fbdev or drm.
    
    * omapdrm, located in drivers/gpu/drm/omapdrm/. This is a drm driver, which
      uses omapdss and the panel/encoder drivers to operate the hardware.
    
    * omapfb, located in drivers/video/fbdev/omap2/omapfb/. This is an fbdev
      driver, which uses omapdss and the panel/encoder drivers to operate the
      hardware.
    
    * omap_vout, located in drivers/media/platform/omap/. This is a v4l2 driver,
      which uses omapdss and omapfb to implement a v4l2 API for the video overlays.
    
    So, on the top level, we have either omapdrm, or omapfb+omap_vout. Both of
    those use the same low level drivers. Without going to the historical details
    why the architecture is like that, I think it's finally time to change that.
    
    The situation with omapfb+omap_vout is that it still works, but no new features
    have been added for a long time, and I want to keep it working as it's still
    being used.  At some point in the future I'd like to remove omapfb and
    omap_vout altogether.
    
    Omapdrm, on the other hand, is being actively developed. Sharing the low level
    parts with omapfb makes that development more difficult than it should be. It
    also "hides" half of the development, as everything happening in the low level
    parts resides under fbdev directory, not in the drm directory.
    
    I've been wanting to clean this up for a long time, but I haven't figured out a
    very good way to do it. I still haven't, but here's the best way I have come up
    with.
    
    This series makes a full copy of the low level parts, omapdss and panel/encoder
    drivers. Both omapfb+omap_vout and omapdrm will have their own versions. The
    copy omapfb+omap_vout get is a new copy, and the copy that omapdrm gets is just
    the current files moved. This way git will associate the omapdrm version with
    the old files.
    
    The omapfb+omap_vout versions won't be touched unless there are some big issues
    there.
    
    The omapdrm versions can be refactored and cleaned up, as the omapfb support
    code is no longer needed. We can perhaps also merge omapdss and omapdrm into
    the same kernel module.
    
    This series only does the copy, and the absolutely necessary parts. No further
    cleanups are done yet.
