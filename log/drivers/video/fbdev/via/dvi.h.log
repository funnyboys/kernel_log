commit f7018c21350204c4cf628462f229d44d03545254
Author: Tomi Valkeinen <tomi.valkeinen@ti.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 13 15:31:38 2014 +0200

    video: move fbdev to drivers/video/fbdev
    
    The drivers/video directory is a mess. It contains generic video related
    files, directories for backlight, console, linux logo, lots of fbdev
    device drivers, fbdev framework files.
    
    Make some order into the chaos by creating drivers/video/fbdev
    directory, and move all fbdev related files there.
    
    No functionality is changed, although I guess it is possible that some
    subtle Makefile build order related issue could be created by this
    patch.
