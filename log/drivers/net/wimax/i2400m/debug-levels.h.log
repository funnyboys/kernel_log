commit 8987691a4aa6622a1b58bb12c56abaf3d2098fad

    wimax/i2400m: allow control of the base-station idle mode timeout
    
    For power saving reasons, WiMAX links can be put in idle mode while
    connected after a certain time of the link not being used for tx or
    rx. In this mode, the device pages the base-station regularly and when
    data is ready to be transmitted, the link is revived.
    
    This patch allows the user to control the time the device has to be
    idle before it decides to go to idle mode from a sysfs
    interace.
    
    It also updates the initialization code to acknowledge the module
    variable 'idle_mode_disabled' when the firmware is a newer version
    (upcoming 1.4 vs 2.6.29's v1.3).
    
    The method for setting the idle mode timeout in the older firmwares is
    much more limited and can be only done at initialization time. Thus,
    the sysfs file will return -ENOSYS on older ones.

    i2400m: host/device procotol and core driver definitions
    
    The wimax/i2400m.h defines the structures and constants for the
    host-device protocols:
    
     - boot / firmware upload protocol
    
     - general data transport protocol
    
     - control protocol
    
    It is done in such a way that can also be used verbatim by user space.
    
    drivers/net/wimax/i2400m.h defines all the APIs used by the core,
    bus-generic driver (i2400m) and the bus specific drivers
    (i2400m-BUSNAME). It also gives a roadmap to the driver
    implementation.
    
    debug-levels.h adds the core driver's debug settings.
