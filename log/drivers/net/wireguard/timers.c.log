    net: WireGuard secure network tunnel
    
    WireGuard is a layer 3 secure networking tunnel made specifically for
    the kernel, that aims to be much simpler and easier to audit than IPsec.
    Extensive documentation and description of the protocol and
    considerations, along with formal proofs of the cryptography, are
    available at:
    
      * https://www.wireguard.com/
      * https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf
    
    This commit implements WireGuard as a simple network device driver,
    accessible in the usual RTNL way used by virtual network drivers. It
    makes use of the udp_tunnel APIs, GRO, GSO, NAPI, and the usual set of
    networking subsystem APIs. It has a somewhat novel multicore queueing
    system designed for maximum throughput and minimal latency of encryption
    operations, but it is implemented modestly using workqueues and NAPI.
    Configuration is done via generic Netlink, and following a review from
    the Netlink maintainer a year ago, several high profile userspace tools
    have already implemented the API.
    
    This commit also comes with several different tests, both in-kernel
    tests and out-of-kernel tests based on network namespaces, taking profit
    of the fact that sockets used by WireGuard intentionally stay in the
    namespace the WireGuard interface was originally created, exactly like
    the semantics of userspace tun devices. See wireguard.com/netns/ for
    pictures and examples.
    
    The source code is fairly short, but rather than combining everything
    into a single file, WireGuard is developed as cleanly separable files,
    making auditing and comprehension easier. Things are laid out as
    follows:
    
      * noise.[ch], cookie.[ch], messages.h: These implement the bulk of the
        cryptographic aspects of the protocol, and are mostly data-only in
        nature, taking in buffers of bytes and spitting out buffers of
        bytes. They also handle reference counting for their various shared
        pieces of data, like keys and key lists.
    
      * ratelimiter.[ch]: Used as an integral part of cookie.[ch] for
        ratelimiting certain types of cryptographic operations in accordance
        with particular WireGuard semantics.
    
      * allowedips.[ch], peerlookup.[ch]: The main lookup structures of
        WireGuard, the former being trie-like with particular semantics, an
        integral part of the design of the protocol, and the latter just
        being nice helper functions around the various hashtables we use.
    
      * device.[ch]: Implementation of functions for the netdevice and for
        rtnl, responsible for maintaining the life of a given interface and
        wiring it up to the rest of WireGuard.
    
      * peer.[ch]: Each interface has a list of peers, with helper functions
        available here for creation, destruction, and reference counting.
    
      * socket.[ch]: Implementation of functions related to udp_socket and
        the general set of kernel socket APIs, for sending and receiving
        ciphertext UDP packets, and taking care of WireGuard-specific sticky
        socket routing semantics for the automatic roaming.
    
      * netlink.[ch]: Userspace API entry point for configuring WireGuard
        peers and devices. The API has been implemented by several userspace
        tools and network management utility, and the WireGuard project
        distributes the basic wg(8) tool.
    
      * queueing.[ch]: Shared function on the rx and tx path for handling
        the various queues used in the multicore algorithms.
    
      * send.c: Handles encrypting outgoing packets in parallel on
        multiple cores, before sending them in order on a single core, via
        workqueues and ring buffers. Also handles sending handshake and cookie
        messages as part of the protocol, in parallel.
    
      * receive.c: Handles decrypting incoming packets in parallel on
        multiple cores, before passing them off in order to be ingested via
        the rest of the networking subsystem with GRO via the typical NAPI
        poll function. Also handles receiving handshake and cookie messages
        as part of the protocol, in parallel.
    
      * timers.[ch]: Uses the timer wheel to implement protocol particular
        event timeouts, and gives a set of very simple event-driven entry
        point functions for callers.
    
      * main.c, version.h: Initialization and deinitialization of the module.
    
      * selftest/*.h: Runtime unit tests for some of the most security
        sensitive functions.
    
      * tools/testing/selftests/wireguard/netns.sh: Aforementioned testing
        script using network namespaces.
    
    This commit aims to be as self-contained as possible, implementing
    WireGuard as a standalone module not needing much special handling or
    coordination from the network subsystem. I expect for future
    optimizations to the network stack to positively improve WireGuard, and
    vice-versa, but for the time being, this exists as intentionally
    standalone.
    
    We introduce a menu option for CONFIG_WIREGUARD, as well as providing a
    verbose debug log and self-tests via CONFIG_WIREGUARD_DEBUG.
