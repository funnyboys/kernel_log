    mlxsw: switchx2: Add IB port support
    
    SwitchX-2 is IB capable device. This patch add a support to change the
    port type between Ethernet and Infiniband.
    
    When the port is set to IB, the FW implements the Subnet Management Agent
    (SMA) manage the port. All port attributes can be control remotely by
    the SM.
    
    Usage:
            $ devlink port show
            pci/0000:03:00.0/1: type eth netdev eth0
            pci/0000:03:00.0/3: type eth netdev eth1
            pci/0000:03:00.0/5: type eth netdev eth2
            pci/0000:03:00.0/6: type eth netdev eth3
            pci/0000:03:00.0/8: type eth netdev eth4
    
            $ devlink port set pci/0000:03:00.0/1 type ib
    
            $ devlink port show
            pci/0000:03:00.0/1: type ib
