    mlxsw: spectrum: Add the multicast routing hardware logic
    
    Implement the multicast routing hardware API introduced in previous patch
    for the specific spectrum hardware.
    
    The spectrum hardware multicast routes are written using the RMFT2 register
    and point to an ACL flexible action set. The actions used for multicast
    routes are:
     - Counter action, which allows counting bytes and packets on multicast
       routes.
     - Multicast route action, which provide RPF check and do the actual packet
       duplication to a list of RIFs.
     - Trap action, in the case the route action specified by the called is
       trap.
