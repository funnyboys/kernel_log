    net/mlx5e: Add XSK zero-copy support
    
    This commit adds support for AF_XDP zero-copy RX and TX.
    
    We create a dedicated XSK RQ inside the channel, it means that two
    RQs are running simultaneously: one for non-XSK traffic and the other
    for XSK traffic. The regular and XSK RQs use a single ID namespace split
    into two halves: the lower half is regular RQs, and the upper half is
    XSK RQs. When any zero-copy AF_XDP socket is active, changing the number
    of channels is not allowed, because it would break to mapping between
    XSK RQ IDs and channels.
    
    XSK requires different page allocation and release routines. Such
    functions as mlx5e_{alloc,free}_rx_mpwqe and mlx5e_{get,put}_rx_frag are
    generic enough to be used for both regular and XSK RQs, and they use the
    mlx5e_page_{alloc,release} wrappers around the real allocation
    functions. Function pointers are not used to avoid losing the
    performance with retpolines. Wherever it's certain that the regular
    (non-XSK) page release function should be used, it's called directly.
    
    Only the stats that could be meaningful for XSK are exposed to the
    userspace. Those that don't take part in the XSK flow are not
    considered.
    
    Note that we don't wait for WQEs on the XSK RQ (unlike the regular RQ),
    because the newer xdpsock sample doesn't provide any Fill Ring entries
    at the setup stage.
    
    We create a dedicated XSK SQ in the channel. This separation has its
    advantages:
    
    1. When the UMEM is closed, the XSK SQ can also be closed and stop
    receiving completions. If an existing SQ was used for XSK, it would
    continue receiving completions for the packets of the closed socket. If
    a new UMEM was opened at that point, it would start getting completions
    that don't belong to it.
    
    2. Calculating statistics separately.
    
    When the userspace kicks the TX, the driver triggers a hardware
    interrupt by posting a NOP to a dedicated XSK ICO (internal control
    operations) SQ, in order to trigger NAPI on the right CPU core. This XSK
    ICO SQ is protected by a spinlock, as the userspace application may kick
    the TX from any core.
    
    Store the pointers to the UMEMs in the net device private context,
    independently from the kernel. This way the driver can distinguish
    between the zero-copy and non-zero-copy UMEMs. The kernel function
    xdp_get_umem_from_qid does not care about this difference, but the
    driver is only interested in zero-copy UMEMs, particularly, on the
    cleanup it determines whether to close the XSK RQ and SQ or not by
    looking at the presence of the UMEM. Use state_lock to protect the
    access to this area of UMEM pointers.
    
    LRO isn't compatible with XDP, but there may be active UMEMs while
    XDP is off. If this is the case, don't allow LRO to ensure XDP can
    be reenabled at any time.
    
    The validation of XSK parameters typically happens when XSK queues
    open. However, when the interface is down or the XDP program isn't
    set, it's still possible to have active AF_XDP sockets and even to
    open new, but the XSK queues will be closed. To cover these cases,
    perform the validation also in these flows:
    
    1. A new UMEM is registered, but the XSK queues aren't going to be
    created due to missing XDP program or interface being down.
    
    2. MTU changes while there are UMEMs registered.
    
    Having this early check prevents mlx5e_open_channels from failing
    at a later stage, where recovery is impossible and the application
    has no chance to handle the error, because it got the successful
    return value for an MTU change or XSK open operation.
    
    The performance testing was performed on a machine with the following
    configuration:
    
    - 24 cores of Intel Xeon E5-2620 v3 @ 2.40 GHz
    - Mellanox ConnectX-5 Ex with 100 Gbit/s link
    
    The results with retpoline disabled, single stream:
    
    txonly: 33.3 Mpps (21.5 Mpps with queue and app pinned to the same CPU)
    rxdrop: 12.2 Mpps
    l2fwd: 9.4 Mpps
    
    The results with retpoline enabled, single stream:
    
    txonly: 21.3 Mpps (14.1 Mpps with queue and app pinned to the same CPU)
    rxdrop: 9.9 Mpps
    l2fwd: 6.8 Mpps
