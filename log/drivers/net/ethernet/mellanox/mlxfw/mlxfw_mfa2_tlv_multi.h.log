commit 410ed13cae39df563e31240992fcb32364d186a1
Author: Yotam Gigi <yotamg@mellanox.com>
Date:   Tue May 23 21:56:23 2017 +0200

    Add the mlxfw module for Mellanox firmware flash process
    
    The mlxfw module is in charge of common logic needed to flash Mellanox
    devices firmware, which consists of:
     - Parse the Mellanox Firmware Archive version 2 (MFA2) format, which is
       the format used to store the Mellanox firmware. The MFA2 format file can
       hold firmware for many different silicon variants, differentiated by a
       unique ID called PSID. In addition, the MFA2 file data section is
       compressed using xz compression to save both file-system space and
       memory at extraction time.
     - Implement the firmware flash state machine logic, which is a common
       logic for Mellanox products needed to flash the firmware to the device.
    
    As the module is shared between different Mellanox products, it defines a
    set of callbacks to be implemented by the specific driver for hardware
    interaction.
