    net: pch_gbe: Remove PCH_GBE_MAC_IFOP_RGMII define
    
    The pch_gbe driver currently presumes that the PHY is connected using
    RGMII, and would need further work to support other buses. It includes a
    define which is always set that conditionalises some of the
    RGMII-specific code regardless. Remove it. If we do ever support
    different MII buses then preprocessor defines won't be the best way to
    select between them anyway.

    net: pch_gbe: Remove sw_reset_phy HAL abstraction
    
    For some reason the pch_gbe driver contains a struct pch_gbe_functions
    with pointers used by a HAL abstraction layer, even though there is only
    one implementation of each function.
    
    This patch removes the sw_reset_phy abstraction, which it turns out is
    never even used. Its one implementation, which is already called
    directly within the same translation unit, can therefore be made static
    and removed from the pch_gbe_phy.h header.

    ethernet: Fix FSF address in file headers
    
    Several files refer to an old address for the Free Software Foundation
    in the file header comment.  Resolve by replacing the address with
    the URL <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/> so that we do not have to keep
    updating the header comments anytime the address changes.

commit f1a26fdf5944ff950888ae0017e546690353f85f
Author: Darren Hart <dvhart@linux.intel.com>
Date:   Sat May 18 14:46:00 2013 -0700

    pch_gbe: Add MinnowBoard support
    
    The MinnowBoard uses an AR803x PHY with the PCH GBE which requires
    special handling. Use the MinnowBoard PCI Subsystem ID to detect this
    and add a pci_device_id.driver_data structure and functions to handle
    platform setup.
    
    The AR803x does not implement the RGMII 2ns TX clock delay in the trace
    routing nor via strapping. Add a detection method for the board and the
    PHY and enable the TX clock delay via the registers.
    
    This PHY will hibernate without link for 10 seconds. Ensure the PHY is
    awake for probe and then disable hibernation. A future improvement would
    be to convert pch_gbe to using PHYLIB and making sure we can wake the
    PHY at the necessary times rather than permanently disabling it.

    Move the OKI Semiconductor driver into driver/net/ethernet/oki-semi/
    and make the necessary Kconfig and Makefile changes.
    
    Note: there is no documented maintainer for this driver, so I CC'd
    the last 2 major contributors.
