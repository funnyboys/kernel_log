commit 4cb584e0ee7df70fd0376aee60cf701855ea8c81
Author: Jakub Kicinski <jakub.kicinski@netronome.com>

    nfp: add CPP access core
    
    Command Push Pull is the name of NFP's network on a chip.
    PCIe PF can access the interconnect through a number of mappings
    controlled via Base Access Registers.  BARs allow the PF to issue
    pretty much any command or address any memory on the chip.
    
    Add appropriate logic and a handful of helper for simple operations
    like reading scalars from memories.
