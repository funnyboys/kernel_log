commit 41c1093f2e1a33f4bf38848b4b1526903c5052bb

    net: qcom/emac: rename emac_phy to emac_sgmii and move it
    
    The EMAC has an internal PHY that is often called the "SGMII".  This
    SGMII is also connected to an external PHY, which is managed by phylib.
    These dual PHYs often cause confusion.  In this case, the data structure
    for managing the SGMII was mis-named and located in the wrong header file.
    
    Structure emac_phy is renamed to emac_sgmii to clearly indicate it applies
    to the internal PHY only.  It also also moved from emac_phy.h (which
    supports the external PHY) to emac_sgmii.h (where it belongs).
    
    To keep the changes minimal, only the structure name is changed, not
    the names of any variables of that type.

    net: emac: emac gigabit ethernet controller driver
    
    Add support for the Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. EMAC gigabit Ethernet
    controller.
    
    This driver supports the following features:
    1) Checksum offload.
    2) Interrupt coalescing support.
    3) SGMII phy.
    4) phylib interface for external phy
