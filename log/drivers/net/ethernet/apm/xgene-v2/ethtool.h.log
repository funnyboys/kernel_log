commit e05ddafd896fccb4568db01fe4de812ca1e6f353
Author: Iyappan Subramanian <isubramanian@apm.com>
Date:   Mon Apr 17 16:47:55 2017 -0700

    drivers: net: xgene-v2: Extend ethtool statistics
    
    This patch adds extended statistics reporting to ethtool.
    
    In summary, this patch,
    
       - adds ethtool.h with the statistics register definitions
       - adds 'struct xge_gstrings_extd_stats' to gather extended stats
       - modifies xge_get_strings(), get_sset_count() and
         get_ethtool_stats() accordingly
       - moves 'struct xge_gstrings_stats' to ethtool.h
