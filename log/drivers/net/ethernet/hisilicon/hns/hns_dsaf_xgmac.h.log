commit 20b3385aaab5af5127fa957bcfcaf0bd92b61447

    net: hns: fix to intimate the link-status change by adding LF/RF method
    
    In current scenario, when the interface is disabled we reset the XGMAC
    RX/TX functionality. This operation does not affects the PHY layer/SFP
    and which appears UP to the remote end(this behaviour is unlike GMAC).
    The result is remote end keeps on sending the packets which gets partly
    processed by XMAC and dropped. Since these are partly processed these
    appears as errored packets in the packet counter statistics.
    
    This patch fixes this behaviour and adds local-fault and remote-fault
    functionality which can be used to intimate the remote peer whenever
    the state of the interface changes. This patch also removes the
    existing hns_dsaf_xge_core_srst_by_port function which was being used
    to reset the RX/TX functionality at XGE Core.

    net: add Hisilicon Network Subsystem DSAF support
    
    DSAF, namely Distributed System Area Fabric, is one of the HNS
    acceleration engine implementation. This patch add DSAF driver to the
    system.
    
    hns_ae_adapt: the adaptor for registering the driver to HNAE framework
    hns_dsaf_mac: MAC cover interface for GE and XGE
    hns_dsaf_gmac: GE (10/100/1000G Ethernet) MAC function
    hns_dsaf_xgmac: XGE (10000+G Ethernet) MAC function
    hns_dsaf_main: the platform device driver for the whole hardware
    hns_dsaf_misc: some misc helper function, such as LED support
    hns_dsaf_ppe: packet process engine function
    hns_dsaf_rcb: ring buffer function
