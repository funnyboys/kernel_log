    Add support of Cavium Liquidio ethernet adapters
    
    Following patch V8 adds support for Cavium Liquidio pci express
    based 10Gig ethernet adapters.
    1) Consolidated all debug macros to either call dev_* or
       netdev_* macros directly, feedback from previous patch.
    2) Changed soft commands to avoid crash when running
       in interrupt context.
    3) Fixed link status not reflecting correct status when NetworkManager
       is running. Added MODULE_FIRMWARE declarations.
    
    Following were the previous patches.
    Patch V7:
    1) Minor comments from v6 release regarding debug statements.
    2) Fix for large multicast lists.
    3) Fixed lockup issue if port initialization fails.
    4) Enabled MSI by default.
    https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/464441/
    
    Patch V6:
    1) Addressed the uint64 vs u64 issue, feedback from previous patch.
    2) Consolidated some receive processing routines.
    3) Removed link status polling method.
    https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/459514/
    
    Patch V5:
    Based on the feedback from earlier patches with regards to
    consolidation of common functions like device init, register
    programming for cn66xx and cn68xx devices.
    https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/438979/
    
    Patch V4:
    Following were the changes based on the feedback from earlier patch:
    1) Added mmiowb while synchronizing queue updates and other hw
       interactions.
    2) Statistics will now be incremented non-atomically per each ring.
       liquidio_get_stats will add stats of each ring while reporting the
       total statistics counts.
    3) Modified liquidio_ioctl  to return proper return codes.
    4) Modified device naming to use standard Ethernet naming.
    5) Global function names in the driver will have lio_/liquidio_/octeon_
       prefix.
    6) Ethtool related changes for:
       Removed redundant stats and jiffies.
       Use default ethtool handler of link status.
       Speed setting will make use of ethtool_cmd_speed_set.
    7) Added checks for pci_map_*  return codes.
    8) Check for signals while waiting in interruptible mode
    https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/435073/
    
    Patch v3:
    Implemented feedback from previous patch like:
    Removed NAPI Config and DEBUG config options, added BQL and xmit_more
    support.
