commit e9117e5099ea29592c2a6180f368951948837a8b
Author: Bert Kenward <bkenward@solarflare.com>
Date:   Thu Nov 17 10:51:54 2016 +0000

    sfc: Firmware-Assisted TSO version 2
    
    Add support for FATSOv2 to the driver. FATSOv2 offloads far more of the task
     of TCP segmentation to the firmware, such that we now just pass a single
     super-packet to the NIC. This means TSO has a great deal in common with a
     normal DMA transmit, apart from adding a couple of option descriptors.
     NIC-specific checks have been moved off the fast path and in to
     initialisation where possible.
    
    This also moves FATSOv1/SWTSO to a new file (tx_tso.c).  The end of transmit
     and some error handling is now outside TSO, since it is common with other
     code.
