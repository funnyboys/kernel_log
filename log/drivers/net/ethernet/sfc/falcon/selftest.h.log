commit 5a6681e22c1409089132085811857d6da828761b
Author: Edward Cree <ecree@solarflare.com>

    sfc: separate out SFC4000 ("Falcon") support into new sfc-falcon driver
    
    Rationale: The differences between Falcon and Siena are in many ways larger
     than those between Siena and EF10 (despite Siena being nominally "Falcon-
     architecture"); for instance, Falcon has no MCPU, so there is no MCDI.
     Removing Falcon support from the sfc driver should simplify the latter,
     and avoid the possibility of Falcon support being broken by changes to sfc
     (which are rarely if ever tested on Falcon, it being end-of-lifed hardware).
    
    The sfc-falcon driver created in this changeset is essentially a copy of the
     sfc driver, but with Siena- and EF10-specific code, including MCDI, removed
     and with the "efx_" identifier prefix changed to "ef4_" (for "EFX 4000-
     series") to avoid collisions when both drivers are built-in.
    
    This changeset removes Falcon from the sfc driver's PCI ID table; then in
     sfc I've removed obvious Falcon-related code: I removed the Falcon NIC
     functions, Falcon PHY code, and EFX_REV_FALCON_*, then fixed up everything
     that referenced them.
    
    Also, increment minor version of both drivers (to 4.1).
    
    For now, CONFIG_SFC selects CONFIG_SFC_FALCON, so that updating old configs
     doesn't cause Falcon support to disappear; but that should be undone at
     some point in the future.
