    wlcore: Force checking of io functions' return values
    
    All io functions' return values should be propagated and handled. Add a
    __must_check annotation to verify that the return values are checked and
    to avoid future mistakes.

    wlcore: Propagate errors from wl1271_raw_read32
    
    Propagate errors from wl1271_raw_read32. Since the read functions had no
    way of returning errors in-band, change their prototypes.
    Also rename prefixes of wlcore functions which their prototypes had to
    be changed.

    wl18xx: read clock frequency and do top init accordingly
    
    Instead of using hardcoded values for a single frequency, we need to
    read the frequency and use the appropriate values for it in the top
    initialization.
