commit 7845af35e0deeb7537de759ebc69d6395d4123bf
Author: Eliad Peller <eliad@wizery.com>
Date:   Thu Jul 30 22:38:22 2015 +0300

    wlcore: add p2p device support
    
    When starting a p2p mgmt interface, enable its device role. This
    allows us to keep the sta role disabled and scan on the dev role.
    
    In general, p2p management interfaces cannot send vif-specific commands
    to FW, as the vif role id is invalid. Only off-channel data and scans
    happen on this vif, so most ops are not relevant.
    
    If the vif is a p2p mgmt vif, block some mac80211 ops.
    
    Configure rate policies for p2p mgmt interface, as
    otherwise p2p packets come out with arbitrary rates.
    
    Since wpa_supplicant currently doesn't support standalone
    p2p device mode (without another attached managed interface),
    add p2p device to the allowed interface combinations without
    decreasing the allowed station count.
    
    Moreover, increase the station count in some cases, as AP
    mode usually starts as station interface, and the AP interface
    is now different from the p2p management one).

    wl12xx/wlcore: move wl1271 struct to wlcore and add ops
    
    In order to add chip-specific operations and prepare for future
    elements that need to be set by the lower driver, move the wl1271
    structure to the wlcore.h file and add an empty placeholder for the
    operations structure.

    wl12xx/wlcore: rename wl12xx to wlcore
    
    Rename the wl12xx driver directory to wlcore as an initial step
    towards the split of the driver into wlcore and wl12xx.  We just
    rename the directory first to keep git blame happy.
