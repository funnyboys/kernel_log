commit fa2648a34e73fb7a17fd0a82e0335a9451d8f5c8
Author: Tony Lindgren <tony@atomide.com>

    wlcore: Add support for runtime PM
    
    We can update wlcore to use PM runtime by adding functions for
    wlcore_runtime_suspend() and wlcore_runtime_resume() and replacing
    calls to wl1271_ps_elp_wakeup() and wl1271_ps_elp_sleep() with calls
    to pm_runtime_get_sync() and pm_runtime_put().
    
    Note that the new wlcore_runtime_suspend() and wlcore_runtime_resume()
    functions are based on simplified versions of wl1271_ps_elp_sleep() and
    wl1271_ps_elp_wakeup().
    
    We don't want to use the old functions as we can now take advantage of
    the runtime PM usage count. And we don't need the old elp_work at all.
    And we can also remove WL1271_FLAG_ELP_REQUESTED that is no longer needed.
    
    Pretty much the only place where we are not just converting the existing
    functions is wl1271_op_suspend() where we add pm_runtime_put_noidle()
    to keep the calls paired.
    
    As the next step is to implement runtime PM autosuspend, let's not add
    wrapper functions for the generic runtime PM calls. We would be getting
    rid of any wrapper functions anyways.
    
    After autoidle we should be able to start using Linux generic wakeirqs
    for the padconf interrupt.

    wl12xx/wlcore: move wl1271 struct to wlcore and add ops
    
    In order to add chip-specific operations and prepare for future
    elements that need to be set by the lower driver, move the wl1271
    structure to the wlcore.h file and add an empty placeholder for the
    operations structure.

    wl12xx/wlcore: rename wl12xx to wlcore
    
    Rename the wl12xx driver directory to wlcore as an initial step
    towards the split of the driver into wlcore and wl12xx.  We just
    rename the directory first to keep git blame happy.
