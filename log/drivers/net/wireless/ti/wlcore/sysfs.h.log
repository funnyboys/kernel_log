commit 33cab57a50531756f28199d63b1a529bc9e01605
Author: Luciano Coelho <coelho@ti.com>
Date:   Sat May 4 02:46:38 2013 +0300

    wlcore: move sysfs handling to a separate file
    
    Instead of doing all the sysfs file handling in the main file, move it
    to a new sysfs source file to reduce the amount of code in a single
    file.
