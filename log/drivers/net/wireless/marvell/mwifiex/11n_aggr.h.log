    mwifiex: don't disable hardirqs; just softirqs
    
    main_proc_lock and int_lock (in mwifiex_adapter) are the only spinlocks
    used in hardirq contexts. The rest are only in task or softirq contexts.
    
    Convert every other lock from *_irq{save,restore}() variants to _bh()
    variants.
    
    This is a mechanical transformation of all spinlock usage in mwifiex
    using the following:
    
    Step 1:
    I ran this nasty sed script:
    
        sed -i -E '/spin_lock_irqsave|spin_unlock_irqrestore/ {
          /main_proc_lock|int_lock/! {
            s:(spin_(un|)lock)_irq(save|restore):\1_bh: ;
            # Join broken lines.
            :a /;$/! {
              N;
              s/\s*\n\s*//;
              ba
            }
            /,.*\);$/ s:,.*\):\):
          }
        }' drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/*
    
    Step 2:
    Manually delete the flags / ra_list_flags args from:
    
      mwifiex_send_single_packet()
      mwifiex_11n_aggregate_pkt()
      mwifiex_send_processed_packet()
    
    which are now unused.
    
    Step 3:
    Apply this semantic patch (coccinelle) to remove the unused 'flags'
    variables:
    
    // <smpl>
    @@
    type T;
    identifier i;
    @@
    
    (
    extern T i;
    |
    - T i;
      ... when != i
    )
    // </smpl>
    
    (Usage is something like this:
    
      make coccicheck COCCI=./patch.cocci MODE=patch M=drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/
    
    although this skips *.h files for some reasons, so I had to massage
    stuff.)
    
    Testing: I've played with a variety of stress tests, including download
    stress tests on the same APs which caught regressions with commit
    5188d5453bc9 ("mwifiex: restructure rx_reorder_tbl_lock usage"). I've
    primarily tested on Marvell 8997 / PCIe, although I've given 8897 / SDIO
    a quick spin as well.
