    wil6210: add debugfs to show PMC ring content
    
    PMC is a hardware debug mechanism which allows capturing real time
    debug data and stream it to host memory. The driver allocates memory
    buffers and set them inside PMC ring of descriptors.
    Add pmcring debugfs that application can use to read the binary
    content of descriptors inside the PMC ring (cat pmcring).

    wil6210: Add pmc debug mechanism memory management
    
    Pmc is a hardware debug mechanism which allows capturing phy data,
    packets, and internally generated events and messages synchronized
    and time stamped by the hardware. It requires memory buffers
    allocated by the driver in order to be used by hardware dma to
    upstream real time debug data to host memory.
    Driver will handle memory allocation and release, and fetching
    the data from the memory to application layer via debug file
    system. The configuration of pmc is handled entirely by the
    application layer.
