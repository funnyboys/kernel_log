    ath11k: driver for Qualcomm IEEE 802.11ax devices
    
    ath11k is a new driver for Qualcomm IEEE 802.11ax devices, first
    supporting only IPQ8074 SoC using the shared memory AHB bus. ath11k
    uses mac80211 and supports AP, Station and Mesh modes.
    
    Even though ath11k has some similar code as with ath10k (especially
    the WMI layer) it was concluded to be simpler to have a "clean start"
    for ath11k code base and not try to share the code with ath10k. This
    makes maintenance easier and avoids major changes in ath10k, which
    would have significantly increased the risk of regressions in existing
    setups.
    
    Even though the driver is very similar with ath10k but there are major
    differences as well. The datapath is completely different. ath11k
    supports multiple MACs, called "soc" in the firmware interface. And
    there's only one WMI interface to support.
    
    Currently ath11k supports only IEEE 802.11ac mode, but patches for
    802.11ax are available and they will be submitted after ath11k is
    accepted to upstream.
    
    The firmware images are available from ath11k-firmware repository but
    they will be also submitted to linux-firmware:
    
    https://github.com/kvalo/ath11k-firmware
    
    This was tested with firmware version WLAN.HK.2.1.0.1-00629-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1.
    
    The driver has had multiple authors who are listed in alphabetical
    order below.
