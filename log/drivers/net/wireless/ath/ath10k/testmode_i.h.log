    ath10k: switch to use SPDX license identifiers
    
    Use SPDX identifiers everywhere in ath10k.
    
    Makefile was incorrectly marked in commit b24413180f56 ("License cleanup: add
    SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license"), fix that as well.

    ath10k: append the wmi_op_version to testmode get_version cmd
    
    QCA9xxx and QCA61x4/QCA93xx are using different wmi operation, in order
    for userspace to differentiate it, appends the wmi_op_version information
    alone with the get_version command.

    ath10k: add testmode
    
    Add testmode interface for starting and using UTF firmware which is used to run
    factory tests. This is implemented by adding new state ATH10K_STATE_UTF and user
    space can enable this state with ATH10K_TM_CMD_UTF_START command. To go back to
    normal mode user space can send ATH10K_TM_CMD_UTF_STOP.
