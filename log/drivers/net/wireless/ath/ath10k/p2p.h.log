    ath10k: switch to use SPDX license identifiers
    
    Use SPDX identifiers everywhere in ath10k.
    
    Makefile was incorrectly marked in commit b24413180f56 ("License cleanup: add
    SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license"), fix that as well.

    ath10k: implement handling of p2p noa event
    
    Since new wmi-tlv firmware doesn't have SWBA event
    the only way to deliver P2P NoA information is
    through a new dedicated event.
    
    This fixes P2P GO Probe Responses to include P2P
    NoA when appropriate on the new firmware.

    ath10k: refactor p2p noa code
    
    Some files are getting bloated and it makes sense
    to split some of the code into separate files. Do
    so with the P2P NoA code and prepare it for reuse.
