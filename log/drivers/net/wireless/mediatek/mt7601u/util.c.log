commit c869f77d6abb5d5f9f2f1a661d5c53862a9cad34
Author: Jakub Kicinski <kubakici@wp.pl>
Date:   Tue May 26 11:16:00 2015 +0200

    add mt7601u driver
    
    Add support for the simplest of MediaTek Wi-Fi devices - MT7601U.
    It is a single stream bgn chip with no bells or whistles.
    This driver is partially based on Felix's mt76 but IMHO it doesn't
    make sense to merge the two right now because MT7601U is a design
    somewhere between old Ralink devices and new Mediatek chips.  There
    wouldn't be all that much code sharing with the devices mt76 supports.
    Situation may obviously change when someone decides to extend m76 with
    support for the more recent USB dongles.
    
    The driver supports only station mode.  I'm hoping to add AP support
    when time allows.
    
    This driver sat on GitHub for quite a while and got some testing there:
