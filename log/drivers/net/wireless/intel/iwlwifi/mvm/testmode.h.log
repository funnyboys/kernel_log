commit 754f890a3aef8211903d314cd9e1fbebe30283cc
Author: Luca Coelho <luciano.coelho@intel.com>
Date:   Fri Aug 24 10:50:45 2018 +0300

    iwlwifi: remove all occurrences of the FSF address paragraph
    
    The Free Software Foundation address is superfluous and causes
    checkpatch to issue a warning when present.  Remove all paragraphs
    with FSF's address to prevent that.
