    iwlwifi: mvm: use firmware LED command where applicable
    
    On devices starting from 8000 series, the host can no longer toggle
    the LED through the CSR_LED_REG register, but must do it via the
    firmware instead. Add support for this. Note that this means that
    the LED cannot be turned on while the firmware is off, so using an
    arbitrary LED trigger may not work as expected.
