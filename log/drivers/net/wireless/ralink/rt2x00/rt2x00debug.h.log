commit 6b81745e36e346e8aa936219d0311b384313bee3
Author: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>
Date:   Wed May 17 16:46:53 2017 +0200

    rt2x00: change function pointers for register accessors
    
    This prepares the driver for changing all the 'read' register accessors
    to return the value instead of passing it by reference. Since a lot
    of them are used in callbacks, this takes care of the callbacks first,
    adding a couple of helpers that will be removed again one at a time.
