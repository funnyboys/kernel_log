commit b72ae8cac0caff86fe414fceb940655c2d1371c9
Author: Andy Shevchenko <andriy.shevchenko@linux.intel.com>
Date:   Sun Jul 29 16:16:56 2018 +0300

    PCI: Add PCI_DEVICE_DATA() macro to fully describe device ID entry
    
    There are a lot of examples in the kernel where PCI_VDEVICE() is used and
    still looks not so convenient due to additional driver_data field attached.
    
    Introduce PCI_DEVICE_DATA() macro to fully describe device ID entry in
    shortest possible form. For example,
    
      before:
    
        { PCI_VDEVICE(INTEL, PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_MRFLD),
          (kernel_ulong_t) &dwc3_pci_mrfld_properties, },
    
      after:
    
        { PCI_DEVICE_DATA(INTEL, MRFLD, &dwc3_pci_mrfld_properties) },
    
    Drivers can be converted later on in independent way.
    
    While here, remove the unused macro with the same name from Ralink wireless
    driver.
