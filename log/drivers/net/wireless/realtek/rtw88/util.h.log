    rtw88: support wowlan feature for 8822c
    
    Wake on WLAN(wowlan) is a feature which allows devices
    to be woken up from suspend state through wlan events.
    
    When user enables wowlan feature and then let the device
    enter suspend state, wowlan firmware will be loaded by
    the driver and periodically monitors wifi packets.
    Power consumption of wifi chip will be reduced in this
    state.
    
    If wowlan firmware detects that specific wlan event
    happens, it will issue wakeup signal to trigger resume
    process. Driver will load normal firmware and let wifi
    chip return to the original state.
    
    Currently supported wlan events include receiving magic packet,
    rekey packet and deauth packet, and disconnecting from AP.

    rtw88: new Realtek 802.11ac driver
    
    This is a new mac80211 driver for Realtek 802.11ac wireless network chips.
    rtw88 now supports RTL8822BE/RTL8822CE now, with basic station mode
    functionalities. The firmware for both can be found at linux-firmware.
    
    https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git
    For RTL8822BE: rtw88/rtw8822b_fw.bin
    For RTL8822CE: rtw88/rtw8822c_fw.bin
    
    And for now, only PCI buses (RTL8xxxE) are supported. We will add support
    for USB and SDIO in the future. The bus interface abstraction can be seen
    in this driver such as hci.h. Most of the hardware setting are the same
    except for some TRX path or probing setup should be separated.
    
    Supported:
    
     * Basic STA/AP/ADHOC mode, and TDLS (STA is well tested)
    
    Missing feature:
    
     * WOW/PNO
     * USB & SDIO bus (such as RTL8xxxU/RTL8xxxS)
     * BT coexistence (8822B/8822C are combo ICs)
     * Multiple interfaces (for now single STA is better supported)
     * Dynamic hardware calibrations (to improve/stabilize performance)
    
    Potential problems:
    
     * static calibration spends too much time, and it is painful for
       driver to leave IDLE state. And slows down associate process.
       But reload function are under development, will be added soon!
     * TRX statictics misleading, as we are not reporting status correctly,
       or say, not reporting for "every" packet.
    
    The next patch set should have BT coexistence code since RTL8822B/C are
    combo ICs, and the driver for BT can be found after Linux Kernel v4.20.
    So it is better to add it first to make WiFi + BT work concurrently.
    
    Although now rtw88 is simple but we are developing more features for it.
    Even we want to add support for more chips such as RTL8821C/RTL8814B.
