    rtlwifi: rtl818x: Move drivers into new realtek directory
    
    Now that a new mac80211-based driver for Realtek devices has been submitted,
    it is time to reorganize the directories. Rather than having directories
    rtlwifi and rtl818x be in drivers/net/wireless/, they will now be in
    drivers/net/wireless/realtek/. This change simplifies the directory
    structure, but does not result in any configuration changes that are
    visable to the user.
