    qtnfmac: introduce new FullMAC driver for Quantenna chipsets
    
    This patch adds support for new FullMAC WiFi driver for Quantenna
    QSR10G chipsets.
    
    QSR10G (aka Pearl) is Quantenna's 8x8, 160M, 11ac offering.
    QSR10G supports 2 simultaneous WMACs - one 5G and one 2G.
    5G WMAC supports 160M, 8x8 configuration. FW supports
    up to 8 concurrent virtual interfaces on each WMAC.
    
    Patch introduces 2 new drivers:
    - qtnfmac.ko for interfacing with kernel wireless core
    - qtnfmac_pearl_pcie.ko for interfacing with hardware over PCIe interface
