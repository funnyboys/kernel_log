    soc: qcom: ipa: main code
    
    This patch includes three source files that represent some basic "main
    program" code for the IPA driver.  They are:
      - "ipa.h" defines the top-level IPA structure which represents an IPA
         device throughout the code.
      - "ipa_main.c" contains the platform driver probe function, along with
        some general code used during initialization.
      - "ipa_reg.h" defines the offsets of the 32-bit registers used for the
        IPA device, along with masks that define the position and width of
        fields within these registers.
      - "version.h" defines some symbolic IPA version numbers.
    
    Each file includes some documentation that provides a little more
    overview of how the code is organized and used.
