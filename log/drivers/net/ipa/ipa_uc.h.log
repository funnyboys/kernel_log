    soc: qcom: ipa: modem and microcontroller
    
    This patch includes code implementing the modem functionality.
    There are several communication paths between the AP and modem,
    separate from the main data path provided by IPA.  SMP2P provides
    primitive messaging and interrupt capability, and QMI allows more
    complex out-of-band messaging to occur between entities on the AP
    and modem.  (SMP2P and QMI support are added by the next patch.)
    Management of these (plus the network device implementing the data
    path) is done by code within "ipa_modem.c".
    
    Sort of unrelated, this patch also includes the code supporting the
    microcontroller CPU present on the IPA.  The microcontroller can be
    used to implement special handling of packets, but at this time we
    don't support that.  Still, it is a component that needs to be
    initialized, and in the event of a crash we need to do some
    synchronization between the AP and the microcontroller.
