    net: phy: Use the correct style for SPDX License Identifier
    
    This patch corrects the SPDX License Identifier style in
    header files related to PHY Layer for Ethernet drivers.
    For C header files Documentation/process/license-rules.rst
    mandates C-like comments (opposed to C source files where
    C++ style should be used). This patch also gives an explicit
    block comment to the SPDX License Identifier.
    
    Changes made by using a script provided by Joe Perches here:

    net: phy: Convert some PHY and MDIO driver files to SPDX headers
    
    Where the license text and the MODULE_LICENSE() value agree, convert
    to using an SPDX header, removing the license text.

commit 453d00defba502a48e3f9a218a519b233ff83d16
Author: Russell King <rmk+kernel@arm.linux.org.uk>

    net: phy: add I2C mdio bus
    
    Add an I2C MDIO bus bridge library, to allow phylib to access PHYs which
    are connected to an I2C bus instead of the more conventional MDIO bus.
    Such PHYs can be found in SFP adapters and SFF modules.
    
    Since PHYs appear at I2C bus address 0x40..0x5f, and 0x50/0x51 are
    reserved for SFP EEPROMs/diagnostics, we must not allow the MDIO bus
    to access these I2C addresses.
