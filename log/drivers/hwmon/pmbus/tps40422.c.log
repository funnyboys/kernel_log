commit a8bfeceb0c1400b9331c00f6969afa6cb82d5d4a
Author: Zhu, Richard \(NSN - CN/Beijing\) <richard.zhu@nsn.com>
Date:   Tue Jul 1 07:14:23 2014 +0000

    hwmon: (pmbus) Add tps40422 front-end driver
    
    For TI power management chip TPS40422, READ_TEMPERATURE_2 command is supported on
    page 1 of the chip, but the original driver(pmbus.c) only tried to detect this command
    on page 0, this will lead to a result that the temperature sensor in page 1 couldn't
    be detected. This change is to isolate the tps40422 driver from pmbus.c into a solo
    front-end driver.
