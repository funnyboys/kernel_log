    soundwire: add Slave sysfs support
    
    Expose MIPI DisCo Slave properties in sysfs.
    
    For Slave properties and Data Port 0, the attributes are managed with
    simple devm_ support.
    
    A Slave Device may have more than one Data Port (DPN), and each Data
    Port can be sink or source. The attributes are created dynamically
    using pre-canned macros, but still use devm_ with a name attribute
    group to avoid creating kobjects - as requested by GregKH. In the
    _show function, we use container_of() to retrieve port number and
    direction required to extract the information.
    
    Audio modes are not supported for now. Depending on the discussions
    the SoundWire Device Class, we may add it later as is or follow the
    new specification.
