commit 346978980a781a5b434c48531cf29cadf5b83999
Author: Mark Brown <broonie@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>

    mfd: Initialise WM8994 register cache after reading chip ID registers
    
    The different devices handled by the WM8994 can be distinguished using
    their ID registers so we don't need to rely on the user having registered
    the device correctly. Instead do the initial regmap setup with a minimal
    configuration only supporting physical I/O and then configure the cache
    once we have identified the device.

commit 01ed260f22c429337272bf9d25d393a4efd37d51

    mfd: Add wm8994 register access and default information
    
    Describe the register map to the regmap core so that we can use its
    diagnostic features and cache support.  This is split out from the patch
    using it due to the size so that the actual code change is a bit clearer.
    
    As the various devices are supersets of each other the access maps are
    built up by layering the functions on top of each other, though the
    interface for specifying the register defaults isn't currently amenable
    to this.
