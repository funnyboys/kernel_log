    PCI: Add SPDX GPL-2.0+ to replace GPL v2 or later boilerplate
    
    Add SPDX GPL-2.0+ to all PCI files that specified the GPL and allowed
    either GPL version 2 or any later version.
    
    Remove the boilerplate GPL version 2 or later language, relying on the
    assertion in b24413180f56 ("License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license
    identifier to files with no license") that the SPDX identifier may be used
    instead of the full boilerplate text.

    PCI: Fix whitespace, capitalization, and spelling errors
    
    Fix whitespace, capitalization, and spelling errors.  No functional change.
    I know "busses" is not an error, but "buses" was more common, so I used it
    consistently.

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
