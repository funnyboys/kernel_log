commit ca632f556697d45d67ed5cada7cedf3ddfe0db4b
Author: Grant Likely <grant.likely@secretlab.ca>
Date:   Mon Jun 6 01:16:30 2011 -0600

    spi: reorganize drivers
    
    Sort the SPI makefile and enforce the naming convention spi_*.c for
    spi drivers.
    
    This change also rolls the contents of atmel_spi.h into the .c file
    since there is only one user of that particular include file.
    
    v2: - Use 'spi-' prefix instead of 'spi_' to match what seems to be
          be the predominant pattern for subsystem prefixes.
        - Clean up filenames in Kconfig and header comment blocks
