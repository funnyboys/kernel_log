    intel_th: Add driver infrastructure for Intel(R) Trace Hub devices
    
    Intel(R) Trace Hub (TH) is a set of hardware blocks (subdevices) that
    produce, switch and output trace data from multiple hardware and
    software sources over several types of trace output ports encoded
    in System Trace Protocol (MIPI STPv2) and is intended to perform
    full system debugging.
    
    For these subdevices, we create a bus, where they can be discovered
    and configured by userspace software.
    
    This patch creates this bus infrastructure, three types of devices
    (source, output, switch), resource allocation, some callback mechanisms
    to facilitate communication between the subdevices' drivers and some
    common sysfs attributes.
