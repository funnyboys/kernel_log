commit 56fa1a6a6a7da91e7ece8b01b0ae8adb2926e434
Author: Sylwester Nawrocki <s.nawrocki@samsung.com>
Date:   Sun Mar 24 16:54:25 2013 +0100

    [media] s5p-fimc: Change the driver directory name to exynos4-is
    
    The s5p-fimc directory now contains drivers for multiple IP blocks
    found in multiple Samsung application processors. This includes FIMC
    (CAMIF), MIPI CSIS and FIMC LITE. FIMC-IS (Imaging Subsystem) driver
    is going to be put into same directory. Hence we rename it to
    exynos4-is as s5p-fimc was only relevant for early version of this
    driver, when it only supported FIMC IP block.
    
    The imaging subsystem drivers for Exynos4 SoC series and S5PV210 will
    be included in drivers/media/platform/exynos4-is directory, with some
    modules shared with exynos5 series, while the rest of exynos5 specific
    modules will find their home in drivers/media/platform/exynos5-is.
