commit da114376d325298cce4a7271c4de9bd41c712266
Author: Sylwester Nawrocki <s.nawrocki@samsung.com>

    [media] exynos4-is: Add FIMC-IS ISP I2C bus driver
    
    This patch adds the ISP I2C bus controller driver files.
    Creating a standard I2C bus adapter, even if the driver doesn't
    actually communicate with the hardware and it is instead
    controlled by the ISP firmware running on the Cortex-A5, allows
    to use standard hardware description in the device tree. As the
    sensor would have actually had a standard V4L2 sub-device driver
    run on the host CPU.
    This approach allows to adapt the driver with a relatively small
    effort should the Imaging Subsystem architecture change so that
    the I2C bus is handled by the host's CPU OS, rather than the
    internal FIMC-IS ARM CPU firmware. The image sensor driver could
    be a standard I2C client driver, as in case of most existing
    image sensors.
