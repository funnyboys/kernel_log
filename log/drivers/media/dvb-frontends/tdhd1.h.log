commit bcb63314e2c23f1ed622418b65f9409512659c73
Author: Sakari Ailus <sakari.ailus@linux.intel.com>
Date:   Fri Oct 28 09:31:20 2016 -0200

    [media] media: Drop FSF's postal address from the source code files
    
    Drop the FSF's postal address from the source code files that typically
    contain mostly the license text. Of the 628 removed instances, 578 are
    outdated.
    
    The patch has been created with the following command without manual edits:
    
    git grep -l "675 Mass Ave\|59 Temple Place\|51 Franklin St" -- \
            drivers/media/ include/media|while read i; do i=$i perl -e '
    open(F,"< $ENV{i}");
    $a=join("", <F>);
    $a =~ s/[ \t]*\*\n.*You should.*\n.*along with.*\n.*(\n.*USA.*$)?\n//m
            && $a =~ s/(^.*)Or, (point your browser to) /$1To obtain the license, $2\n$1/m;
    close(F);
    open(F, "> $ENV{i}");
    print F $a;
    close(F);'; done

commit 991ce92f8de24cde063d531246602b6e14d3fef2
Author: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@osg.samsung.com>
Date:   Fri Dec 4 10:38:59 2015 -0200

    [media] use https://linuxtv.org for LinuxTV URLs
    
    While https was always supported on linuxtv.org, only in
    Dec 3 2015 the website is using valid certificates.
    
    As we're planning to drop pure http support on some
    future, change all references at the media subsystem
    to point to the https URL instead.

    [media] move the dvb/frontends to drivers/media/dvb-frontends
    
    Raise the DVB frontends one level up, as the intention is to remove
