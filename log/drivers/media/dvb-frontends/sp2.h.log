    treewide: remove redundant #include <linux/kconfig.h>
    
    Kernel source files need not include <linux/kconfig.h> explicitly
    because the top Makefile forces to include it with:
    
      -include $(srctree)/include/linux/kconfig.h
    
    This commit removes explicit includes except the following:
    
      * arch/s390/include/asm/facilities_src.h
      * tools/testing/radix-tree/linux/kernel.h
    
    These two are used for host programs.

commit 868736ad3404b205794bc04233eca58293818dea
Author: Olli Salonen <olli.salonen@iki.fi>

    [media] sp2: Add I2C driver for CIMaX SP2 common interface module
    
    Driver for the CIMaX SP2 common interface chip. It is very much based on
    the existing cimax2 driver for cx23885, but should be more reusable. The
    product has been sold with name Atmel T90FJR as well and the data sheets
    for that chip seem to be publicly available.
    
    It seems that the USB device that I have and the cx23885 based devices will
    need to interact differently with the chip for the CAM operations. Thus
    there is one callback function that is passed on to the sp2 driver
    (see function sp2_ci_op_cam for that one).
    
    IRQ functionality is not included currently (not needed by USB devices
    and I don't have a PCIe device for development).
