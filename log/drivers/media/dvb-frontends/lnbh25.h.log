Author: Masahiro Yamada <yamada.masahiro@socionext.com>
Date:   Tue Oct 11 13:55:58 2016 -0700

    treewide: remove redundant #include <linux/kconfig.h>
    
    Kernel source files need not include <linux/kconfig.h> explicitly
    because the top Makefile forces to include it with:
    
      -include $(srctree)/include/linux/kconfig.h
    
    This commit removes explicit includes except the following:
    
      * arch/s390/include/asm/facilities_src.h
      * tools/testing/radix-tree/linux/kernel.h
    
    These two are used for host programs.

    [media] lnbh25: Fix lnbh25_attach() function return type
    
    If CONFIG_DVB_LNBH25 is disabled, a stub static inline function is
    defined that just prints a warning about the driver being disabled
    but the function return type was wrong which caused a build error.
    
    Fixes: e025273b86fb ("[media] lnbh25: LNBH25 SEC controller driver")

     fe_sec_voltage_t should not be used in kernelspace anymore.
     instead, it should use enum fe_sec_voltage]
