commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd
Author: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    [media] Add and use IS_REACHABLE macro
    
    In the media drivers, the v4l2 core knows about all submodules
    and calls into them from a common function. However this cannot
    work if the modules that get called are loadable and the
    core is built-in. In that case we get
    
    drivers/built-in.o: In function `set_type':
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:301: undefined reference to `tea5767_attach'
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:307: undefined reference to `tea5761_attach'
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:349: undefined reference to `tda9887_attach'
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:405: undefined reference to `xc4000_attach'
    
    This was working previously, until the IS_ENABLED() macro was used
    to replace the construct like
    
     #if defined(CONFIG_DVB_CX24110) || (defined(CONFIG_DVB_CX24110_MODULE) && defined(MODULE))
    
    with the difference that the new code no longer checks whether it is being
    built as a loadable module itself.
    
    To fix this, this new patch adds an 'IS_REACHABLE' macro, which evaluates
    true in exactly the condition that was used previously. The downside
    of this is that this trades an obvious link error for a more subtle
    runtime failure, but it is clear that the change that introduced the
    link error was unintentional and it seems better to revert it for
    now. Also, a similar change was originally created by Trent Piepho
    and then reverted by teh change to the IS_ENABLED macro.
    
    Ideally Kconfig would be used to avoid the case of a broken dependency,
    or the code restructured in a way to turn around the dependency, but either
    way would require much larger changes here.

    [media] drxk: remove the option to load firmware asynchronously
    
    The option to load firmware asynchronously were added due to
    a requirement with a few versions of udev. It turns that this was
    a bad idea and caused regressions on drxk-based devices.
    
    So, we end by only letting the firmware to be loaded syncronously
    everywhere.
    
    So, let's remove the bad code.

    Thare are lots of CamelCase warnings produced by checkpatch.pl.
    This weren't fixed at the time the driver got submitted due

    Now that I have one script that automates this task, cleans

    drxk: allow loading firmware synchrousnously
    
    Due to udev-182, the firmware load was changed to be async, as
    otherwise udev would give up of loading a firmware.
    
    Add an option to return to the previous behaviour, async firmware
    loads cause failures with the tda18271 driver.
    
    Antti tested it with the following hardware:
            Hauppauge WinTV HVR 930C
            MaxMedia UB425-TC
            PCTV QuatroStick nano (520e)
    
    Tested-by: Antti Palosaari <crope@iki.fi>
    Cc: stable@kernel.org # for Kernel 3.6 - please note that driver location has changed

    [media] move the dvb/frontends to drivers/media/dvb-frontends
    
    Raise the DVB frontends one level up, as the intention is to remove
    the drivers/media/dvb directory.
