commit 38b2df95c53be4bd5421d933ca0dabbcb82741d0
Author: Devin Heitmueller <dheitmueller@kernellabs.com>
Date:   Mon Aug 13 21:18:02 2012 -0300

    [media] drx-j: add a driver for Trident drx-j frontend
    
    Add support for the Trident DRX-J driver, including a card profile for the
    PCTV 80e which uses the chip.
    
    Thanks to Trident for allowing the release of this code under a BSD license,
    and of course Hauppauge/PCTV for pushing for its release to the community.
    
    [pdickeybeta@gmail.com: modified to fix compilation errors and also to move
     the driver files from the drx39xy subdirectory to the frontends directory]
    
    [m.chehab@samsung.com: fix merge conflicts, commented drx-j compilation and
     added EM28XX_R06_I2C_CLK setup also to the board setup]
