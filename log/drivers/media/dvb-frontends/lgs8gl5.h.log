commit 97139d4a6f26445de47b378cddd5192c0278f863
Author: Masahiro Yamada <yamada.masahiro@socionext.com>
Date:   Tue Oct 11 13:55:58 2016 -0700

    treewide: remove redundant #include <linux/kconfig.h>
    
    Kernel source files need not include <linux/kconfig.h> explicitly
    because the top Makefile forces to include it with:
    
      -include $(srctree)/include/linux/kconfig.h
    
    This commit removes explicit includes except the following:
    
      * arch/s390/include/asm/facilities_src.h
      * tools/testing/radix-tree/linux/kernel.h
    
    These two are used for host programs.

commit 9b174527e7b756cda9f5d9e541f87b7fec9cfdf0
Author: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>

    [media] Add and use IS_REACHABLE macro
    
    In the media drivers, the v4l2 core knows about all submodules
    and calls into them from a common function. However this cannot
    work if the modules that get called are loadable and the
    core is built-in. In that case we get
    
    drivers/built-in.o: In function `set_type':
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:301: undefined reference to `tea5767_attach'
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:307: undefined reference to `tea5761_attach'
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:349: undefined reference to `tda9887_attach'
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:405: undefined reference to `xc4000_attach'
    
    This was working previously, until the IS_ENABLED() macro was used
    to replace the construct like
    
     #if defined(CONFIG_DVB_CX24110) || (defined(CONFIG_DVB_CX24110_MODULE) && defined(MODULE))
    
    with the difference that the new code no longer checks whether it is being
    built as a loadable module itself.
    
    To fix this, this new patch adds an 'IS_REACHABLE' macro, which evaluates
    true in exactly the condition that was used previously. The downside
    of this is that this trades an obvious link error for a more subtle
    runtime failure, but it is clear that the change that introduced the
    link error was unintentional and it seems better to revert it for
    now. Also, a similar change was originally created by Trent Piepho
    and then reverted by teh change to the IS_ENABLED macro.
    
    Ideally Kconfig would be used to avoid the case of a broken dependency,
    or the code restructured in a way to turn around the dependency, but either
    way would require much larger changes here.

    Raise the DVB frontends one level up, as the intention is to remove
