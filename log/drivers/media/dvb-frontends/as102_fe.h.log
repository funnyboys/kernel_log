commit 901b9dd5e31e8c58e30bf81ea4ab12641fb3ea76

    media: update/fix my e-mail on some places
    
    There are two places pointing to an unexisting "m.chehab@kernel.org"
    email. I never had such email, so, I'm unsure how it ends there.
    Anyway, it is plain wrong.
    
    While here, use my canonical e-mail on a bunch of places that
    are pointing to another e-mail. The idea is that, from now on,
    all places will be pointing to the same SMTP server.
