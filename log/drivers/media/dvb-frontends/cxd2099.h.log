    media: dvb-frontends/cxd2099: add SPDX license identifier
    
    As both the MODULE_LICENSE and the boilerplates are now in sync and clear
    that the driver is licensed under the terms of the GPLv2-only, add a
    matching SPDX license identifier tag.

    media: ddbridge, cxd2099: include guard, fix unneeded NULL init, strings
    
    Three really tiny minors in this single commit which all on their own
    would just clutter up the commit history unnecessarily:
    
    * ddbridge-regs.h is lacking an include guard. Add it.
    * Fix an unnecessary NULL initialisation in ddbridge-ci. The declaration
      of the ci struct ptr is immediately followed by kzalloc().
    * Clarify that the CXD2099AR is a Sony device in the cxd2099 driver at a
      few places including Kconfig.

    media: dvb-frontends/cxd2099: remove remainders from old attach way
    
    As all drivers using the cxd2099 are converted to handle attach/detach
    the generic I2C client way, the static inline cxd2099_attach isn't
    required anymore. Thus cleanup cxd2099.h from the remainders, the adr
    struct member also isn't used anymore.

    media: cxd2099: move driver out of staging into dvb-frontends
    
    According to the TODO file, this driver only landed in staging because of
    the way device nodes and data transfers are handled. Besides that this way
    (use of secX devices) has become sort of standard to date (ie. VDR
    supports this literally since ages via the ddci plugin, TVHeadend received
    this functionality lately, and minisatip being currently worked on
    regarding this), most importantly this I2C client only driver isn't even
    responsible for setting up device nodes, not for handling data
    transfer and so on, but only serves as interface for the dvb_ca_en50221
    subsystem, just like every other DVB card out in the wild, with hard-wired
    or such flexible CA interfaces. And, it would even work with cards having
    the cxd2099 controller hard-wired.
    
    Also, this driver received quite some love and even is a proper I2C client
    driver by now. So, as this driver acts as a EN50221 frontend device, move
    it to dvb-frontends. There is no need to keep it buried in staging.
    
    This commit also updates all affected Kconfig and Makefile's, and adds
    MEDIA_AUTOSELECT depends to ddbridge and ngene.
