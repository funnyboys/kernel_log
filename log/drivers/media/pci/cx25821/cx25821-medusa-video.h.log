commit bcb63314e2c23f1ed622418b65f9409512659c73

    [media] media: Drop FSF's postal address from the source code files
    
    Drop the FSF's postal address from the source code files that typically
    contain mostly the license text. Of the 628 removed instances, 578 are
    outdated.
    
    The patch has been created with the following command without manual edits:
    
    git grep -l "675 Mass Ave\|59 Temple Place\|51 Franklin St" -- \
            drivers/media/ include/media|while read i; do i=$i perl -e '
    open(F,"< $ENV{i}");
    $a=join("", <F>);
    $a =~ s/[ \t]*\*\n.*You should.*\n.*along with.*\n.*(\n.*USA.*$)?\n//m
            && $a =~ s/(^.*)Or, (point your browser to) /$1To obtain the license, $2\n$1/m;
    close(F);
    open(F, "> $ENV{i}");
    print F $a;
    close(F);'; done

    [media] cx25821: fix sparse warnings

    drivers/media/pci/cx25821/cx25821-medusa-video.h:44:16: warning: symbol '_num_cameras' was not declared. Should it be static?
    drivers/media/pci/cx25821/cx25821-medusa-video.h:46:14: warning: symbol '_video_standard' was not declared. Should it be static?
    drivers/media/pci/cx25821/cx25821-medusa-video.h:47:5: warning: symbol '_display_field_cnt' was not declared. Should it be static?
    After analyzing the last four warnings carefully it became clear that these
    variables were really completely unused. As a result of that the call to
    medusa_set_decoderduration() is now dubious since the duration is always 0.
    Without documentation, however, I can't tell what the right value is.
