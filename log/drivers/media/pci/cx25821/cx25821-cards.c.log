    [media] media: Drop FSF's postal address from the source code files
    
    Drop the FSF's postal address from the source code files that typically
    contain mostly the license text. Of the 628 removed instances, 578 are
    outdated.
    
    The patch has been created with the following command without manual edits:
    
    git grep -l "675 Mass Ave\|59 Temple Place\|51 Franklin St" -- \
            drivers/media/ include/media|while read i; do i=$i perl -e '
    open(F,"< $ENV{i}");
    $a=join("", <F>);
    $a =~ s/[ \t]*\*\n.*You should.*\n.*along with.*\n.*(\n.*USA.*$)?\n//m
            && $a =~ s/(^.*)Or, (point your browser to) /$1To obtain the license, $2\n$1/m;
    close(F);
    open(F, "> $ENV{i}");

    drivers/media/pci/cx25821/cx25821-medusa-video.h:47:5: warning: symbol '_display_field_cnt' was not declared. Should it be static?
    After analyzing the last four warnings carefully it became clear that these
    variables were really completely unused. As a result of that the call to
    medusa_set_decoderduration() is now dubious since the duration is always 0.
    Without documentation, however, I can't tell what the right value is.

    [media] cx25821: remove references to subdevices that aren't there
    
    This driver does not have subdevices, so why call subdev ops? After
    removing that it became apparent that only Composite is supported as
    input, so remove also any reference to other inputs.

    [media] cx25821: remove unused fields, ioctls
    
    Do some spring cleaning:
    - there are no board defines with tuners, so remove bogus tuner support.
    - tv standard handling has nothing to do with tuners, so keep that.
    - replace the deprecated current_norm by g_std.
    - querystd isn't implemented, so remove the ioctl.
    - remove a bunch of unused fields in cx25821.h
