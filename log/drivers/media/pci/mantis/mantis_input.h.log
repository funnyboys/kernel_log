commit a96762da0cfcbe27f18febb84797269cd9faf791
Author: Jan Klötzke <jan@kloetzke.net>

    [media] mantis: add remote control support
    
    The embedded UART is apparently used to receive decoded IR (RC5?) codes.
    Forward these scan codes to the RC framework and (where known) add
    corresponding mapping tables to translate them into regular keys.
    
    This patch has been tested on a TechniSat CableStar HD2. The mappings of other
    rc-maps were taken from Christoph Pinkl's patch
    (http://patchwork.linuxtv.org/patch/7217/) and the s2-liplianin repository. The
    major difference to Christoph's patch is a reworked interrupt handling of the
    UART because the RX interrupt is apparently level triggered and requires
    masking until the FIFO is read by the UART worker.
