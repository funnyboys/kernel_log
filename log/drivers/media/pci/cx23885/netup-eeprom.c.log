commit e39682b5d96ae7a33a0f6b5578911913be8f14b6
Author: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@osg.samsung.com>
Date:   Sun Nov 13 09:46:11 2016 -0200

    [media] cx23885: convert it to use pr_foo() macros
    
    Instead of calling printk() directly, use pr_foo()
    macros, as suggested at the Kernel's coding style.
    
    Please notice that a conversion to dev_foo() is not trivial,
    as several parts on this driver uses pr_cont().

    [media] cx23885: remove FSF address as per checkpatch
    
    These addresses are usually out-of-date and the top-level license will
    always have the right address. So drop it from these sources.
