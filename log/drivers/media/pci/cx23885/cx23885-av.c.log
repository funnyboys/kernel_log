    [media] cx23885: uninitialized variable in cx23885_av_work_handler()
    
    The "handled" variable could be uninitialized if the
    interrupt_service_routine() call back hasn't been implimented or if it
    has been implemented but doesn't initialize "handled" to zero at the
    start.  For example, adv76xx_isr() only sets "handled" to true.

commit 5bc08e1921e46101457d3be09835697490177fdd
Author: Luis Alves <ljalvs@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Jul 24 09:06:01 2013 -0300

    [media] cx23885[v4]: Fix interrupt storm when enabling IR receiver
    
    Apparently the Flatiron genereates an interrupt after the built-in self
    test for each of its left and right channels has completed.
    
    Apparently Conexant wire-OR'ed the Flatiron's interrupt output with the
    interrupt output of the CX23885 A/V core.
    
    Those interrupts need to be handled, otherwise, they generate an
    interrrupt request storm.
    
    So:
    
    - Add flatiron readreg and writereg functions prototypes
      on a new header file;
    - Modify the av interrupt handler to cleanup flatiron IRQs if no other
      interrupt handling happens.
