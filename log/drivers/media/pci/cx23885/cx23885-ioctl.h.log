    [media] cx23885: remove FSF address as per checkpatch
    
    These addresses are usually out-of-date and the top-level license will
    always have the right address. So drop it from these sources.

    [media] cx23885: remove g_chip_ident
    
    Replace g_chip_ident by g_chip_info. Note that the IR support is implemented
    as a subdev, so this part no longer needs to be handled as a 'bridge' chip.
