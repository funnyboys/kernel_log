    [media] cx23885: remove FSF address as per checkpatch
    
    These addresses are usually out-of-date and the top-level license will
    always have the right address. So drop it from these sources.

commit 5bc08e1921e46101457d3be09835697490177fdd
Author: Luis Alves <ljalvs@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Jul 24 09:06:01 2013 -0300

    [media] cx23885[v4]: Fix interrupt storm when enabling IR receiver
    
    Apparently the Flatiron genereates an interrupt after the built-in self
    test for each of its left and right channels has completed.
    
    Apparently Conexant wire-OR'ed the Flatiron's interrupt output with the
    interrupt output of the CX23885 A/V core.
    
    Those interrupts need to be handled, otherwise, they generate an
    interrrupt request storm.
    
    So:
    
    - Add flatiron readreg and writereg functions prototypes
      on a new header file;
    - Modify the av interrupt handler to cleanup flatiron IRQs if no other
      interrupt handling happens.
