    [media] media: Drop FSF's postal address from the source code files
    
    Drop the FSF's postal address from the source code files that typically
    contain mostly the license text. Of the 628 removed instances, 578 are
    outdated.
    
    The patch has been created with the following command without manual edits:
    
    git grep -l "675 Mass Ave\|59 Temple Place\|51 Franklin St" -- \
            drivers/media/ include/media|while read i; do i=$i perl -e '
    open(F,"< $ENV{i}");
    $a=join("", <F>);
    $a =~ s/[ \t]*\*\n.*You should.*\n.*along with.*\n.*(\n.*USA.*$)?\n//m
            && $a =~ s/(^.*)Or, (point your browser to) /$1To obtain the license, $2\n$1/m;
    close(F);
    open(F, "> $ENV{i}");
    print F $a;
    close(F);'; done

commit 314527acbbb3f33f72c2ef19d8cfabcada9912a5
Author: Hans Verkuil <hans.verkuil@cisco.com>

    [media] v4l2: pass std by value to the write-only s_std ioctl
    
    This ioctl is defined as IOW, so pass the argument by value instead of by
    reference. I could have chosen to add const instead, but this is 1) easier
    to handle in drivers and 2) consistent with the s_std subdev operation.
