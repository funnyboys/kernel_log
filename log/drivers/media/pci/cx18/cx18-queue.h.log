    [media] media: Drop FSF's postal address from the source code files
    
    Drop the FSF's postal address from the source code files that typically
    contain mostly the license text. Of the 628 removed instances, 578 are
    outdated.
    
    The patch has been created with the following command without manual edits:
    
    git grep -l "675 Mass Ave\|59 Temple Place\|51 Franklin St" -- \
            drivers/media/ include/media|while read i; do i=$i perl -e '
    open(F,"< $ENV{i}");
    $a=join("", <F>);
    $a =~ s/[ \t]*\*\n.*You should.*\n.*along with.*\n.*(\n.*USA.*$)?\n//m
            && $a =~ s/(^.*)Or, (point your browser to) /$1To obtain the license, $2\n$1/m;
    close(F);
    open(F, "> $ENV{i}");
    print F $a;
    close(F);'; done
