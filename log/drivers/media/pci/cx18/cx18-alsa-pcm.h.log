    [media] media: Drop FSF's postal address from the source code files
    
    Drop the FSF's postal address from the source code files that typically
    contain mostly the license text. Of the 628 removed instances, 578 are
    outdated.
    
    The patch has been created with the following command without manual edits:
    
    git grep -l "675 Mass Ave\|59 Temple Place\|51 Franklin St" -- \
            drivers/media/ include/media|while read i; do i=$i perl -e '
    open(F,"< $ENV{i}");
    $a=join("", <F>);
    $a =~ s/[ \t]*\*\n.*You should.*\n.*along with.*\n.*(\n.*USA.*$)?\n//m
            && $a =~ s/(^.*)Or, (point your browser to) /$1To obtain the license, $2\n$1/m;
    close(F);
    open(F, "> $ENV{i}");
    print F $a;
    close(F);'; done

    [media] cx18/ivtv: fix regression: remove __init from a non-init function
    
    Commits 5e6e81b2890db3969527772a8350825a85c22d5c (cx18) and
    2aebbf6737212265b917ed27c875c59d3037110a (ivtv) added an __init
    annotation to the cx18-alsa-load and ivtv-alsa-load functions. However,
    these functions are called *after* initialization by the main cx18/ivtv
    driver. By that time the memory containing those functions is already
    freed and your machine goes BOOM.
