    Drop the FSF's postal address from the source code files that typically
    contain mostly the license text. Of the 628 removed instances, 578 are
    outdated.
    
    The patch has been created with the following command without manual edits:
    
    git grep -l "675 Mass Ave\|59 Temple Place\|51 Franklin St" -- \
            drivers/media/ include/media|while read i; do i=$i perl -e '

    [media] cx18/ivtv: fix regression: remove __init from a non-init function
    
    Commits 5e6e81b2890db3969527772a8350825a85c22d5c (cx18) and
    2aebbf6737212265b917ed27c875c59d3037110a (ivtv) added an __init
    annotation to the cx18-alsa-load and ivtv-alsa-load functions. However,
    these functions are called *after* initialization by the main cx18/ivtv
    driver. By that time the memory containing those functions is already
    freed and your machine goes BOOM.

    [media] ivtv, ivtv-alsa: Add initial ivtv-alsa interface driver for ivtv
    
    This is a cut-and-paste port of the cx18-alsa driver to
    create an ivtv-alsa interface module for the ivtv driver.
    It is not actually hooked-up to the PCM stream DMA buffers
    from the ivtv driver yet.  That will be done in a coming change,
    since that portion is so very different from the cx18 driver.
    This code has all or more of the bugs and shortcomings of the
    cx18-alsa interface driver: inconsistent use of itvsc->slock,
    ivtv-alsa-mixer.c is dead code, assumes 48 ksps regardless
    of the actual setting of the audio capture, problems with
    proper struct ivtv and struct ivtv_stream housekeeping,
    struct ivtv_open_id.v4l2_fh abuse, and $DIETY knows what else.
