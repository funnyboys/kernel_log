    [media] media: Drop FSF's postal address from the source code files
    
    Drop the FSF's postal address from the source code files that typically
    contain mostly the license text. Of the 628 removed instances, 578 are
    outdated.
    
    The patch has been created with the following command without manual edits:
    
    git grep -l "675 Mass Ave\|59 Temple Place\|51 Franklin St" -- \
            drivers/media/ include/media|while read i; do i=$i perl -e '
    open(F,"< $ENV{i}");
    $a=join("", <F>);
    $a =~ s/[ \t]*\*\n.*You should.*\n.*along with.*\n.*(\n.*USA.*$)?\n//m
            && $a =~ s/(^.*)Or, (point your browser to) /$1To obtain the license, $2\n$1/m;
    close(F);
    open(F, "> $ENV{i}");
    print F $a;

commit 269c11fbac4f7b4ed58e77f3049b64b55a342234
Author: Andy Walls <awalls@md.metrocast.net>
Date:   Sun Sep 2 19:13:14 2012 -0300

    [media] ivtv, ivtv-alsa: Add initial ivtv-alsa interface driver for ivtv
    
    This is a cut-and-paste port of the cx18-alsa driver to
    create an ivtv-alsa interface module for the ivtv driver.
    It is not actually hooked-up to the PCM stream DMA buffers
    from the ivtv driver yet.  That will be done in a coming change,
    since that portion is so very different from the cx18 driver.
    This code has all or more of the bugs and shortcomings of the
    cx18-alsa interface driver: inconsistent use of itvsc->slock,
    ivtv-alsa-mixer.c is dead code, assumes 48 ksps regardless
    of the actual setting of the audio capture, problems with
    proper struct ivtv and struct ivtv_stream housekeeping,
    struct ivtv_open_id.v4l2_fh abuse, and $DIETY knows what else.
