    media: tuners: Use the correct style for SPDX License Identifier
    
    This patch corrects the SPDX License Identifier style
    in header file related to media Drivers for Analog TV Tuners.
    For C header files Documentation/process/license-rules.rst
    mandates C-like comments (opposed to C source files where
    C++ style should be used)
    
    Changes made by using a script provided by Joe Perches here:
    https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/2/7/46.

    MAINTAINERS & files: Canonize the e-mails I use at files
    
    From now on, I'll start using my @kernel.org as my development e-mail.
    
    As such, let's remove the entries that point to the old
    mchehab@s-opensource.com at MAINTAINERS file.
    
    For the files written with a copyright with mchehab@s-opensource,
    let's keep Samsung on their names, using mchehab+samsung@kernel.org,
    in order to keep pointing to my employer, with sponsors the work.
    
    For the files written before I join Samsung (on July, 4 2013),
    let's just use mchehab@kernel.org.
    
    For bug reports, we can simply point to just kernel.org, as
    this will reach my mchehab+samsung inbox anyway.

    media: tuners: add SPDX identifiers to the code I wrote
    
    As we're now using SPDX identifiers, on the several
    media drivers I wrote, add the proper SPDX, identifying
    the license I meant.
    
    As we're now using the short license, it doesn't make sense to
    keep the original license text.
    
    Also, fix MODULE_LICENSE to properly identify GPL v2.

    [media] common: move media/common/tuners to media/tuners
    
    Move the tuners one level up, as the "common" directory will be used
    by drivers that are shared between more than one driver.
