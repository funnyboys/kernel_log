    treewide: remove redundant #include <linux/kconfig.h>
    
    Kernel source files need not include <linux/kconfig.h> explicitly
    because the top Makefile forces to include it with:
    
      -include $(srctree)/include/linux/kconfig.h
    
    This commit removes explicit includes except the following:
    
      * arch/s390/include/asm/facilities_src.h
      * tools/testing/radix-tree/linux/kernel.h
    
    These two are used for host programs.

commit 9b174527e7b756cda9f5d9e541f87b7fec9cfdf0
Author: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>

    [media] Add and use IS_REACHABLE macro
    
    In the media drivers, the v4l2 core knows about all submodules
    and calls into them from a common function. However this cannot
    work if the modules that get called are loadable and the
    core is built-in. In that case we get
    
    drivers/built-in.o: In function `set_type':
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:301: undefined reference to `tea5767_attach'
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:307: undefined reference to `tea5761_attach'
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:349: undefined reference to `tda9887_attach'
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:405: undefined reference to `xc4000_attach'
    
    This was working previously, until the IS_ENABLED() macro was used
    to replace the construct like
    
     #if defined(CONFIG_DVB_CX24110) || (defined(CONFIG_DVB_CX24110_MODULE) && defined(MODULE))
    
    with the difference that the new code no longer checks whether it is being
    built as a loadable module itself.
    
    To fix this, this new patch adds an 'IS_REACHABLE' macro, which evaluates
    true in exactly the condition that was used previously. The downside
    of this is that this trades an obvious link error for a more subtle
    runtime failure, but it is clear that the change that introduced the
    link error was unintentional and it seems better to revert it for
    now. Also, a similar change was originally created by Trent Piepho
    and then reverted by teh change to the IS_ENABLED macro.
    
    Ideally Kconfig would be used to avoid the case of a broken dependency,
    or the code restructured in a way to turn around the dependency, but either
    way would require much larger changes here.

    [media] xc5000: add IF output level control
    
    Adds control of the IF output level to the xc5000 tuner
    configuration structure.  Increases the IF level to the
    demodulator to fix failure to lock and picture breakup
    issues (with the au8522 demodulator, in the case of the
    Hauppauge HVR950Q).
    
    This patch works with all XC5000 firmware versions.
