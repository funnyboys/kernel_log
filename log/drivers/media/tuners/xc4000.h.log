    [media] media: Drop FSF's postal address from the source code files
    
    Drop the FSF's postal address from the source code files that typically
    contain mostly the license text. Of the 628 removed instances, 578 are
    outdated.
    
    The patch has been created with the following command without manual edits:
    
    git grep -l "675 Mass Ave\|59 Temple Place\|51 Franklin St" -- \
            drivers/media/ include/media|while read i; do i=$i perl -e '

    $a =~ s/[ \t]*\*\n.*You should.*\n.*along with.*\n.*(\n.*USA.*$)?\n//m
            && $a =~ s/(^.*)Or, (point your browser to) /$1To obtain the license, $2\n$1/m;

commit 9b174527e7b756cda9f5d9e541f87b7fec9cfdf0
Author: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>
Date:   Wed Feb 18 14:12:42 2015 -0300

    [media] Add and use IS_REACHABLE macro
    
    In the media drivers, the v4l2 core knows about all submodules
    and calls into them from a common function. However this cannot
    work if the modules that get called are loadable and the
    core is built-in. In that case we get
    
    drivers/built-in.o: In function `set_type':
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:301: undefined reference to `tea5767_attach'
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:307: undefined reference to `tea5761_attach'
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:349: undefined reference to `tda9887_attach'
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:405: undefined reference to `xc4000_attach'
    
    This was working previously, until the IS_ENABLED() macro was used
    to replace the construct like
    
     #if defined(CONFIG_DVB_CX24110) || (defined(CONFIG_DVB_CX24110_MODULE) && defined(MODULE))
    
    with the difference that the new code no longer checks whether it is being
    built as a loadable module itself.
    
    To fix this, this new patch adds an 'IS_REACHABLE' macro, which evaluates
    true in exactly the condition that was used previously. The downside
    of this is that this trades an obvious link error for a more subtle
    runtime failure, but it is clear that the change that introduced the
    link error was unintentional and it seems better to revert it for
    now. Also, a similar change was originally created by Trent Piepho
    and then reverted by teh change to the IS_ENABLED macro.
    
    Ideally Kconfig would be used to avoid the case of a broken dependency,
    or the code restructured in a way to turn around the dependency, but either
    way would require much larger changes here.

    [media] use IS_ENABLED() macro
    
    This patch introduces the use of IS_ENABLED() macro. For example,
    replacing:
     #if defined(CONFIG_I2C) || (defined(CONFIG_I2C_MODULE) && defined(MODULE))
    with:
     #if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_I2C)
    All changes made by this patch respect the same replacement pattern.

    [media] common: move media/common/tuners to media/tuners
    
    Move the tuners one level up, as the "common" directory will be used
    by drivers that are shared between more than one driver.
