commit 9b174527e7b756cda9f5d9e541f87b7fec9cfdf0
Author: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>

    [media] Add and use IS_REACHABLE macro
    
    In the media drivers, the v4l2 core knows about all submodules
    and calls into them from a common function. However this cannot
    work if the modules that get called are loadable and the
    core is built-in. In that case we get
    
    drivers/built-in.o: In function `set_type':
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:301: undefined reference to `tea5767_attach'
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:307: undefined reference to `tea5761_attach'
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:349: undefined reference to `tda9887_attach'
    drivers/media/v4l2-core/tuner-core.c:405: undefined reference to `xc4000_attach'
    
    This was working previously, until the IS_ENABLED() macro was used
    to replace the construct like
    
     #if defined(CONFIG_DVB_CX24110) || (defined(CONFIG_DVB_CX24110_MODULE) && defined(MODULE))
    
    with the difference that the new code no longer checks whether it is being
    built as a loadable module itself.
    
    To fix this, this new patch adds an 'IS_REACHABLE' macro, which evaluates
    true in exactly the condition that was used previously. The downside
    of this is that this trades an obvious link error for a more subtle
    runtime failure, but it is clear that the change that introduced the
    link error was unintentional and it seems better to revert it for
    now. Also, a similar change was originally created by Trent Piepho
    and then reverted by teh change to the IS_ENABLED macro.
    
    Ideally Kconfig would be used to avoid the case of a broken dependency,
    or the code restructured in a way to turn around the dependency, but either
    way would require much larger changes here.

    [media] r820t: Remove a warning for an unused value
    
    Currently, the driver complains about the pre_detect var:
    
            drivers/media/tuners/r820t.c: In function 'r820t_sysfreq_sel':
            drivers/media/tuners/r820t.c:722:31: warning: variable 'pre_dect' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
    
    While rtl8232 code comments it, perhaps some other driver may use.
    So, the better is to keep the code there, allowing to enable it
    via r820t config data.

    [media] r820t: proper initialize the PLL register
    
    The rtl-sdr library, from where this driver was initially
    based, doesn't use half PLL clock, but this is used on
    the Realtek Kernel driver. So, also do the same here.

    [media] r820t: Add a tuner driver for Rafael Micro R820T silicon tuner
    
    This driver was written from scratch, based on an existing driver
    that it is part of rtl-sdr git tree, released under GPLv2:
            https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ultra-cheap-sdr/Y3rBEOFtHug
            https://github.com/n1gp/gr-baz
            http://cgit.osmocom.org/rtl-sdr/plain/src/tuner_r820t.c
            (there are also other variants of it out there)
    >From what I understood from the threads, the original driver was converted
    to userspace from a Realtek tree. I couldn't find the original tree.
    However, the original driver look awkward on my eyes. So, I decided to
    write a new version from it from the scratch, while trying to reproduce
    everything found there.
    TODO:
    - After locking, the original driver seems to have some routines to
      improve reception. This was not implemented here yet.
    - RF Gain set/get is not implemented.
