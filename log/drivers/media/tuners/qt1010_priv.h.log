commit a3f90c75b833caeff123499e13e0e31cbecf7d5b
Author: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>

    media: dvb: convert tuner_info frequencies to Hz
    
    Right now, satellite tuner drivers specify frequencies in kHz,
    while terrestrial/cable ones specify in Hz. That's confusing
    for developers.
    
    However, the main problem is that universal tuners capable
    of handling both satellite and non-satelite delivery systems
    are appearing. We end by needing to hack the drivers in
    order to support such hybrid tuners.
    
    So, convert everything to specify tuner frequencies in Hz.
    
    Plese notice that a similar patch is also needed for frontends.

    [media] media: Drop FSF's postal address from the source code files
    
    Drop the FSF's postal address from the source code files that typically
    contain mostly the license text. Of the 628 removed instances, 578 are
    outdated.
    
    The patch has been created with the following command without manual edits:
    
    git grep -l "675 Mass Ave\|59 Temple Place\|51 Franklin St" -- \
            drivers/media/ include/media|while read i; do i=$i perl -e '
    open(F,"< $ENV{i}");
    $a=join("", <F>);
    $a =~ s/[ \t]*\*\n.*You should.*\n.*along with.*\n.*(\n.*USA.*$)?\n//m
            && $a =~ s/(^.*)Or, (point your browser to) /$1To obtain the license, $2\n$1/m;
    close(F);
    open(F, "> $ENV{i}");
    print F $a;
    close(F);'; done

    [media] common: move media/common/tuners to media/tuners
    
    Move the tuners one level up, as the "common" directory will be used
    by drivers that are shared between more than one driver.
