    media: gspca: Convert PDEBUG to gspca_dbg
    
    Use a more typical logging style.
    
    The current macro hides the gspca_dev argument so add it to the
    macro uses instead.
    
    Miscellanea:
    
    o Add missing '\n' terminations to formats
    o Realign arguments to open parenthesis
    o Remove commented out uses of PDEBUG

    [media] media: Drop FSF's postal address from the source code files
    
    Drop the FSF's postal address from the source code files that typically
    contain mostly the license text. Of the 628 removed instances, 578 are
    outdated.
    
    The patch has been created with the following command without manual edits:
    
    git grep -l "675 Mass Ave\|59 Temple Place\|51 Franklin St" -- \
            drivers/media/ include/media|while read i; do i=$i perl -e '
    open(F,"< $ENV{i}");
    $a=join("", <F>);
    $a =~ s/[ \t]*\*\n.*You should.*\n.*along with.*\n.*(\n.*USA.*$)?\n//m
            && $a =~ s/(^.*)Or, (point your browser to) /$1To obtain the license, $2\n$1/m;
    close(F);
    open(F, "> $ENV{i}");
    print F $a;
    close(F);'; done

    [media] gspca: Remove gspca-specific debug magic
    
    Instead use v4l2_dbg and v4l2_err. Note that the PDEBUG macro is kept to
    make this patch-set less invasive, but it is simply a wrapper around
    v4l2_dbg now. Most of the other changes are there to make the dev parameter
    for the v4l2_xxx macros available everywhere we do logging.
