    USB: Storage: Use the correct style for SPDX License Identifier
    
    This patch corrects the SPDX License Identifier style in
    header files related to USB Storage driver configuration.
    For C header files Documentation/process/license-rules.rst
    mandates C-like comments (opposed to C source files where
    C++ style should be used).
    
    Changes made by using a script provided by Joe Perches here:

    USB: storage: Remove redundant license text
    
    Now that the SPDX tag is in all USB files, that identifies the license
    in a specific and legally-defined manner.  So the extra GPL text wording
    can be removed as it is no longer needed at all.
    
    This is done on a quest to remove the 700+ different ways that files in
    the kernel describe the GPL license text.  And there's unneeded stuff
    like the address (sometimes incorrect) for the FSF which is never
    needed.
    
    No copyright headers or other non-license-description text was removed.

    USB: add SPDX identifiers to all remaining files in drivers/usb/
    
    It's good to have SPDX identifiers in all files to make it easier to
    audit the kernel tree for correct licenses.
    
    Update the drivers/usb/ and include/linux/usb* files with the correct
    SPDX license identifier based on the license text in the file itself.
    The SPDX identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which can be used
    instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This work is based on a script and data from Thomas Gleixner, Philippe
    Ombredanne, and Kate Stewart.

    usb-storage: restrict bcdDevice range for Super Top in Cypress ATACB
    
    The Cypress ATACB unusual-devs entry for the Super Top SATA bridge
    causes problems.  Although it was originally reported only for
    bcdDevice = 0x160, its range was much larger.  This resulted in a bug
    report for bcdDevice 0x220, so the range was capped at 0x219.  Now
    Milan reports errors with bcdDevice 0x150.
    
    Therefore this patch restricts the range to just 0x160.

    USB: usb-storage: unusual_devs update for Super TOP SATA bridge
    
    The current entry in unusual_cypress.h for the Super TOP SATA bridge devices
    seems to be causing corruption on newer revisions of this device.  This has
    been reported in Arch Linux and Fedora.  The original patch was tested on
    devices with bcdDevice of 1.60, whereas the newer devices report bcdDevice
    as 2.20.  Limit the UNUSUAL_DEV entry to devices less than 2.20.
    
    This fixes https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=909591
