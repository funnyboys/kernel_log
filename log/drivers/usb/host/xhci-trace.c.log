    USB: host: xhci: Remove redundant license text
    
    Now that the SPDX tag is in all USB files, that identifies the license
    in a specific and legally-defined manner.  So the extra GPL text wording
    can be removed as it is no longer needed at all.
    
    This is done on a quest to remove the 700+ different ways that files in
    the kernel describe the GPL license text.  And there's unneeded stuff
    like the address (sometimes incorrect) for the FSF which is never
    needed.
    
    No copyright headers or other non-license-description text was removed.

    USB: add SPDX identifiers to all remaining files in drivers/usb/
    
    It's good to have SPDX identifiers in all files to make it easier to
    audit the kernel tree for correct licenses.
    
    Update the drivers/usb/ and include/linux/usb* files with the correct
    SPDX license identifier based on the license text in the file itself.
    The SPDX identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which can be used
    instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This work is based on a script and data from Thomas Gleixner, Philippe
    Ombredanne, and Kate Stewart.

    In preparation for allowing the xHCI host controller drivers to be built
    as separate modules, export symbols from the xHCI core that may be used

commit 84a99f6fc5d4a2b7583aa287979268a8bb926367

    xhci: add traces for debug messages in xhci_address_device()
    
    This patch declares an event class for trace events that
    trace messages with variadic arguments, called xhci_log_msg,
    and defines a trace event for tracing the debug messages in
    xhci_address_device() function, called xhci_dbg_address.
    
    In order to implement this type of trace events, a wrapper function,
    called xhci_dbg_trace(), was created that records the format string
    and variadic arguments into a va_format structure which is passed as
    argument to the tracepoints of the class xhci_log_msg.
    
    All the xhci_dbg() calls in xhci_address_device() are replaced
    with calls to xhci_dbg_trace(). The functionality of xhci_dbg()
    log messages was not removed though, but it is placed inside
    xhci_dbg_trace().
    
    This trace event aims to give the ability to the user or the
    developper to isolate and trace the debug messages generated
    when an Address Device Command is issued to xHC.
