    usb: ohci: Proper handling of ed_rm_list to handle race condition between usb_kill_urb() and finish_unlinks()
    
    There is a race condition between finish_unlinks->finish_urb() function
    and usb_kill_urb() in ohci controller case. The finish_urb calls
    spin_unlock(&ohci->lock) before usb_hcd_giveback_urb() function call,
    then if during this time, usb_kill_urb is called for another endpoint,
    then new ed will be added to ed_rm_list at beginning for unlink, and
    ed_rm_list will point to newly added.
    
    When finish_urb() is completed in finish_unlinks() and ed->td_list
    becomes empty as in below code (in finish_unlinks() function):
    
            if (list_empty(&ed->td_list)) {
                    *last = ed->ed_next;
                    ed->ed_next = NULL;
            } else if (ohci->rh_state == OHCI_RH_RUNNING) {
                    *last = ed->ed_next;
                    ed->ed_next = NULL;
                    ed_schedule(ohci, ed);
            }
    
    The *last = ed->ed_next will make ed_rm_list to point to ed->ed_next
    and previously added ed by usb_kill_urb will be left unreferenced by
    ed_rm_list. This causes usb_kill_urb() hang forever waiting for
    finish_unlink to remove added ed from ed_rm_list.
    
    The main reason for hang in this race condtion is addition and removal
    of ed from ed_rm_list in the beginning during usb_kill_urb and later
    last* is modified in finish_unlinks().
    
    As suggested by Alan Stern, the solution for proper handling of
    ohci->ed_rm_list is to remove ed from the ed_rm_list before finishing
    any URBs. Then at the end, we can add ed back to the list if necessary.
    
    This properly handle the updated ohci->ed_rm_list in usb_kill_urb().

    USB: add SPDX identifiers to all remaining files in drivers/usb/
    
    It's good to have SPDX identifiers in all files to make it easier to
    audit the kernel tree for correct licenses.
    
    Update the drivers/usb/ and include/linux/usb* files with the correct
    SPDX license identifier based on the license text in the file itself.
    The SPDX identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which can be used
    instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This work is based on a script and data from Thomas Gleixner, Philippe
    Ombredanne, and Kate Stewart.

    USB: OHCI: Don't mark EDs as ED_OPER if scheduling fails
    
    Since ed_schedule begins with marking the ED as "operational",
    the ED may be left in such state even if scheduling actually
    fails.
    
    This allows future submission attempts to smuggle this ED to the
    hardware behind the scheduler's back and without linking it to
    the ohci->eds_in_use list.
    
    The former causes bandwidth saturation and data loss on isoc
    endpoints, the latter crashes the kernel when attempt is made
    to unlink such ED from this list.
    
    Fix ed_schedule to update ED state only on successful return.

    USB: OHCI: Fix race between ED unlink and URB submission
    
    This patch fixes a bug introduced by commit 977dcfdc6031 ("USB: OHCI:
    don't lose track of EDs when a controller dies").  The commit changed
    ed_state from ED_UNLINK to ED_IDLE too early, before finish_urb() had
    been called.  The user-visible consequence is that the driver
    occasionally crashes or locks up when an URB is submitted while
    another URB for the same endpoint is being unlinked.
    
    This patch moves the ED state change later, to the right place.  The
    drawback is that now we may unnecessarily execute some instructions
    multiple times when a controller dies.  Since controllers dying is an
    exceptional occurrence, a little wasted time won't matter.

    USB: OHCI: add I/O watchdog for orphan TDs
    
    Some OHCI controllers have a bug: They fail to add completed TDs to
    the done queue.  Examining this queue is the only method ohci-hcd has
    for telling when a transfer is complete; failure to add a TD can
    result in an URB that never completes and cannot be unlinked.
    
    This patch adds a watchdog routine to ohci-hcd.  The routine
    periodically scans the active ED and TD lists, looking for TDs which
    are finished but not on the done queue.  When one is found, and it is
    certain that the controller hardware will never add the TD to the done
    queue, the watchdog routine manually puts the TD on the done list so
    that it can be handled normally.
    
    The watchdog routine also checks for a condition indicating the
    controller has died.  If the done queue is non-empty but the
    HccaDoneHead pointer hasn't been updated for a few hundred
    milliseconds, we assume the controller will never update it and
    therefore is dead.

    USB: OHCI: make URB completions single-threaded
    
    URBs for a particular endpoint should complete sequentially.  That is,
    we shouldn't call the completion handler for one URB until the handler
    for the previous URB has returned.
    
    When the OHCI watchdog routine is added, there will be two paths for
    completing URBs: interrupt handler and watchdog routine.  Their
    activities have to be synchronized so that completions don't occur in
    multiple threads concurrently.
    
    For that purpose, this patch creates an ohci_work() routine which will
    be responsible for calling process_done_list() and finish_unlinks(),
    the two routines that detect when an URB is complete.  Everything will
    funnel through ohci_work(), and it will be careful not to run in more
    than one thread at a time.

    USB: OHCI: redesign the TD done list
    
    This patch changes the way ohci-hcd handles the TD done list.  In
    addition to relying on the TD pointers stored by the controller
    hardware, we need to handle TDs that the hardware has forgotten about.
    
    This means the list has to exist even while the dl_done_list() routine
    isn't running.  That function essentially gets split in two:
    update_done_list() reads the TD pointers stored by the hardware and
    adds the TDs to the done list, and process_done_list() scans through
    the list to handle URB completions.  When we detect a TD that the
    hardware forgot about, we will be able to add it to the done list
    manually and then process it normally.
    
    Since the list is really a queue, and because there can be a lot of
    TDs, keep the existing singly linked implementation.  To insure that
    URBs are given back in order of submission, whenever a TD is added to
    the done list, all the preceding TDs for the same endpoint must be
    added as well (going back to the first one that isn't already on the
    done list).
    
    The done list manipulations must all be protected by the private
    lock.  The scope of the lock is expanded in preparation for the
    watchdog routine to be added in a later patch.
    
    We have to be more careful about giving back unlinked URBs.  Since TDs
    may be added to the done list by the watchdog routine and not in
    response to a controller interrupt, we have to check explicitly to
    make sure all the URB's TDs that were added to the done list have been
    processed before giving back the URB.

    USB: OHCI: revert the ZF Micro orphan-TD quirk
    
    This patch reverts the important parts of commit 89a0fd18a96e (USB:
    OHCI handles more ZFMicro quirks), namely, the parts related to
    handling orphan TDs for interrupt endpoints.  A later patch in this
    series will introduce a more general mechanism that applies to all
    endpoint types and all controllers.

    USB: OHCI: don't lose track of EDs when a controller dies
    
    This patch fixes a bug in ohci-hcd.  When an URB is unlinked, the
    corresponding Endpoint Descriptor is added to the ed_rm_list and taken
    off the hardware schedule.  Once the ED is no longer visible to the
    hardware, finish_unlinks() handles the URBs that were unlinked or have
    completed.  If any URBs remain attached to the ED, the ED is added
    back to the hardware schedule -- but only if the controller is
    running.
    
    This fails when a controller dies.  A non-empty ED does not get added
    back to the hardware schedule and does not remain on the ed_rm_list;
    ohci-hcd loses track of it.  The remaining URBs cannot be unlinked,
    which causes the USB stack to hang.
    
    The patch changes finish_unlinks() so that non-empty EDs remain on
    the ed_rm_list if the controller isn't running.  This requires moving
    some of the existing code around, to avoid modifying the ED's hardware
    fields more than once.

    USB: OHCI: accept very late isochronous URBs
    
    Commit 24f531371de1 (USB: EHCI: accept very late isochronous URBs)
    changed the isochronous API provided by ehci-hcd.  URBs submitted too
    late, so that the time slots for all their packets have already
    expired, are no longer rejected outright.  Instead the submission is
    accepted, and the URB completes normally with a -EXDEV error for each
    packet.  This is what client drivers expect.
    
    This patch implements the same policy in ohci-hcd.  The change is more
    complicated than it was in ehci-hcd, because ohci-hcd doesn't scan for
    isochronous completions in the same way as ehci-hcd does.  Rather, it
    depends on the hardware adding completed TDs to a "done queue".  Some
    OHCI controller don't handle this properly when a TD's time slot has
    already expired, so we have to avoid adding such TDs to the schedule
    in the first place.  As a result, if the URB was submitted too late
    then none of its TDs will get put on the schedule, so none of them
    will end up on the done queue, so the driver will never realize that
    the URB should be completed.
    
    To solve this problem, the patch adds one to urb_priv->td_cnt for such
    URBs, making it larger than urb_priv->length (td_cnt already gets set
    to the number of TD's that had to be skipped because their slots have
    expired).  Each time an URB is given back, the finish_urb() routine
    looks to see if urb_priv->td_cnt for the next URB on the same endpoint
    is marked in this way.  If so, it gives back the next URB right away.
    
    This should be applied to all kernels containing commit 815fa7b91761
    (USB: OHCI: fix logic for scheduling isochronous URBs).

    This contains :
         -Moved sb800_prefetch() function from ohci-pci.c to pci-quirks.c file
          and EXPORTed, this is part of the effort to move the ohci pci related
          code to generic pci code.
         -Passed "device" argument instead  of "ohci_hcd" in sb800_prefetch()
          function to avoid extra include file in pci-quirks.c.
    
    V2:
         -Passed "device" argment instead of "pci_dev", then we use to_pci_dev()
          to get the "pci_dev" structure.

    USB: OHCI: workaround for hardware bug: retired TDs not added to the Done Queue
    
    This patch (as1636) is a partial workaround for a hardware bug
    affecting OHCI controllers by NVIDIA at least, maybe others too.  When
    the controller retires a Transfer Descriptor, it is supposed to add
    the TD onto the Done Queue.  But sometimes this doesn't happen, with
    the result that ohci-hcd never realizes the corresponding transfer has
    finished.  Symptoms can vary; a typical result is that USB audio stops
    working after a while.
    
    The patch works around the problem by recognizing that TDs are always
    processed in order.  Therefore, if a later TD is found on the Done
    Queue than all the earlier TDs for the same endpoint must be finished
    as well.
    
    Unfortunately this won't solve the problem in cases where the missing
    TD is the last one in the endpoint's queue.  A complete fix would
    require a signficant amount of change to the driver.

    OHCI: implement new semantics for URB_ISO_ASAP
    
    This patch (as1614) updates the isochronous scheduling in ohci-hcd to
    match the new semantics for URB_ISO_ASAP.  Testing revealed a hardware
    bug in the way my OHCI controller handles expired isochronous TDs;
    consequently the patch tries hard to avoid creating them (unlike the
    ehci-hcd and uhci-hcd drivers).

    USB host: Move AMD PLL quirk to pci-quirks.c
    
    This patch moves the AMD PLL quirk code in OHCI/EHCI driver to pci-quirks.c,
    and exports the functions to be used by xHCI driver later.
    
    AMD PLL quirk disable the optional PM feature inside specific
    SB700/SB800/Hudson-2/3 platforms under the following conditions:
    
    1. If an isochronous device is connected to OHCI/EHCI/xHCI port and is active;
    2. Optional PM feature that powers down the internal Bus PLL when the link is
       in low power state is enabled.
    
    Without AMD PLL quirk, USB isochronous stream may stutter or have breaks
    occasionally, which greatly impair the performance of audio/video streams.
    
    Currently AMD PLL quirk is implemented in OHCI and EHCI driver, and will be
    added to xHCI driver too. They are doing similar things actually, so move
    the quirk code to pci-quirks.c, which has several advantages:
    
    1. Remove duplicate defines and functions in OHCI/EHCI (and xHCI) driver and
       make them cleaner;
    2. AMD chipset information will be probed only once and then stored.
       Currently they're probed during every OHCI/EHCI initialization, move
       the detect code to pci-quirks.c saves the repeat detect cost;
    3. Build up synchronization among OHCI/EHCI/xHCI driver. In current
       code, every host controller enable/disable PLL only according to
       its own status, and may enable PLL while there is still isoc transfer on
       other HCs. Move the quirk to pci-quirks.c prevents this issue.

    percpu.h is included by sched.h and module.h and thus ends up being
    included when building most .c files.  percpu.h includes slab.h which
    in turn includes gfp.h making everything defined by the two files
    universally available and complicating inclusion dependencies.
    
    percpu.h -> slab.h dependency is about to be removed.  Prepare for
    this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those
    headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion
    needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is
    used as the basis of conversion.
    
      http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py
    
    The script does the followings.
    
    * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that
      only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,
      gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.
    
    * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include
      blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms
      to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains
      core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -
      alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there
      doesn't seem to be any matching order.
    
    * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly
      because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out
      an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the
      file.
    
    The conversion was done in the following steps.
    
    1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly
       over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h
       and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400
       files.
    
    2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,
       some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or
       embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added
       inclusions to around 150 files.
    
    3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits
       from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.
    
    4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.
       e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab
       APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.
    
    5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically
       editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h
       files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h
       inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually
       wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each
       slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as
       necessary.
    
    6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.
    
    7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures
       were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my
       distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few
       more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things
       build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).
    
       * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.
       * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig
       * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig
       * ia64 SMP allmodconfig
       * s390 SMP allmodconfig
       * alpha SMP allmodconfig
       * um on x86_64 SMP allmodconfig
    
    8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as
       a separate patch and serve as bisection point.
    
    Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step
    6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch.
    If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch
    headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of
    the specific arch.

    USB: quirk PLL power down mode
    
    On some AMD 700 series southbridges, ISO OUT transfers (such as audio
    playback through speakers) on the USB OHCI controller may be corrupted
    when an A-Link express power saving feature is active.
    
    PLL power down mode in conjunction with link power management feature
    L1 being enabled is the bad combination ... this patch prevents them
    from being enabled when ISO transfers are pending.

    USB: ohci_hcd hang: submit vs. rmmod race
    
    If we do rmmod ohci_hcd while an application is doing something, the
    following may happen:
    
    - a control URB completes (in finish_urb) and the ohci's endpoint is
      set into ED_UNLINK in ed_deschedule
    - same URB is (re)submitted because of the open/close loop or other
      such application behaviour
    - rmmod sets the state to HC_STATE_QUESCING
    - finish_unlinks happens at next SOF; normally it would set ed into
      ED_IDLE and immediately call ed_schedule (since URB had extra TDs
      queued), which sets it into ED_OPER. But the check in ed_schedule
      makes it fail with -EAGAIN (which is ignored)
    - from now on we have a dead URB stuck; it cannot even be unlinked
      because the ed status is not ED_OPER, and thus start_ed_unlink is
      not invoked.
    
    This patch removes the check. In 2.6.25, all callers check for
    __ACTIVE bit before invoking ed_schedule, which is more appropriate.
    
    Alan Stern and David Brownell approved of this (cautiously).

    USB: ohci - record data toggle after unlink
    
    This patch fixes a problem with OHCI where canceling bulk or
    interrupt URBs may lose track of the right data toggle.  This
    seems to be a longstanding bug, possibly dating back to the
    Linux 2.4 kernel, which stayed hidden because
    
     (a) about half the time the data toggle bit was correct;
     (b) canceling such URBs is unusual; and
     (c) the few drivers which cancel these URBs either
          [1] do it only as part of shutting down, or
          [2] have fault recovery logic, which recovers.
    
    For those transfer types, the toggle is normally written back
    into the ED when each TD is retired.  But canceling bypasses
    the mechanism used to retire TDs ... so on average, half the
    time the toggle bit will be invalid after cancelation.
    
    The fix is simple:  the toggle state of any canceled TDs are
    propagated back to the ED in the finish_unlinks function.

    USB: avoid the donelist after an error in ohci-hcd
    
    This patch (as972) changes ohci-hcd so that after an error occurs, the
    remaining TDs for the URB will be skipped over entirely instead of
    going through the donelist.  This enables the driver to give back the
    URB as soon as the error is detected, avoiding the need to store the
    error status in urb->status.

    USB: add urb->unlinked field
    
    This patch (as970) adds a new urb->unlinked field, which is used to
    store the status of unlinked URBs since we can't use urb->status for
    that purpose any more.  To help simplify the HCDs, usbcore will check
    urb->unlinked before calling the completion handler; if the value is
    set it will automatically override the status reported by the HCD.

    USB: centralize -EREMOTEIO handling
    
    This patch (as969) continues the ongoing changes to the way HCDs
    report URB statuses.  The programming interface has been simplified by
    making usbcore responsible for clearing urb->hcpriv and for setting
    -EREMOTEIO status when an URB with the URB_SHORT_NOT_OK flag ends up
    as a short transfer.
    
    By moving the work out of the HCDs, this removes a fair amount of
    repeated code.

    USB: make HCDs responsible for managing endpoint queues
    
    This patch (as954) implements a suggestion of David Brownell's.  Now
    the host controller drivers are responsible for linking and unlinking
    URBs to/from their endpoint queues.  This eliminates the possiblity of
    strange situations where usbcore thinks an URB is linked but the HCD
    thinks it isn't.  It also means HCDs no longer have to check for URBs
    being dequeued before they were fully enqueued.
    
    In addition to the core changes, this requires changing every host
    controller driver and the root-hub URB handler.  For the most part the
    required changes are fairly small; drivers have to call
    usb_hcd_link_urb_to_ep() in their urb_enqueue method,
    usb_hcd_check_unlink_urb() in their urb_dequeue method, and
    usb_hcd_unlink_urb_from_ep() before giving URBs back.  A few HCDs make
    matters more complicated by the way they split up the flow of control.
    
    In addition some method interfaces get changed.  The endpoint argument
    for urb_enqueue is now redundant so it is removed.  The unlink status
    is required by usb_hcd_check_unlink_urb(), so it has been added to
    urb_dequeue.

    USB: OHCI handles more ZFMicro quirks
    
    The ZF Micro OHCI controller exhibits unexpected behavior that seems to be
    related to high load.  Under certain conditions, the controller will
    complete a TD, remove it from the endpoint's queue, and fail to add it to
    the donelist. This causes the endpoint to appear to stop responding. Worse,
    if the device is removed while in that state, OHCI will hang while waiting
    for the orphaned TD to complete.  The situation is not recoverable without
    rebooting.
    
    This fix enhances the scope of the existing OHCI_QUIRK_ZFMICRO flag:
    
     1. A watchdog routine periodically scans the OHCI structures to check
        for orphaned TDs. In these cases the TD is taken back from the
        controller and completed normally.
    
     2. If a device is removed while the endpoint is hung but before the
        watchdog catches the situation, any outstanding TDs are taken back
        from the controller in the 'sanitize' phase.
    
    The ohci-hcd driver used to print "INTR_SF lossage" in this situation;
    this changes it to the universally accurate "ED unlink timeout".  Other
    instances of this message presumably have different root causes.
    
    Both this Compaq quirk and a NEC quirk are now properly compiled out for
    non-PCI builds of this driver.

commit 7d12e780e003f93433d49ce78cfedf4b4c52adc5
Author: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 5 14:55:46 2006 +0100

    IRQ: Maintain regs pointer globally rather than passing to IRQ handlers
    
    Maintain a per-CPU global "struct pt_regs *" variable which can be used instead
    of passing regs around manually through all ~1800 interrupt handlers in the
    Linux kernel.
    
    The regs pointer is used in few places, but it potentially costs both stack
    space and code to pass it around.  On the FRV arch, removing the regs parameter
    from all the genirq function results in a 20% speed up of the IRQ exit path
    (ie: from leaving timer_interrupt() to leaving do_IRQ()).
    
    Where appropriate, an arch may override the generic storage facility and do
    something different with the variable.  On FRV, for instance, the address is
    maintained in GR28 at all times inside the kernel as part of general exception
    handling.
    
    Having looked over the code, it appears that the parameter may be handed down
    through up to twenty or so layers of functions.  Consider a USB character
    device attached to a USB hub, attached to a USB controller that posts its
    interrupts through a cascaded auxiliary interrupt controller.  A character
    device driver may want to pass regs to the sysrq handler through the input
    layer which adds another few layers of parameter passing.
    
    I've build this code with allyesconfig for x86_64 and i386.  I've runtested the
    main part of the code on FRV and i386, though I can't test most of the drivers.
    I've also done partial conversion for powerpc and MIPS - these at least compile
    with minimal configurations.
    
    This will affect all archs.  Mostly the changes should be relatively easy.
    Take do_IRQ(), store the regs pointer at the beginning, saving the old one:
    
            struct pt_regs *old_regs = set_irq_regs(regs);
    
    And put the old one back at the end:
    
            set_irq_regs(old_regs);
    
    Don't pass regs through to generic_handle_irq() or __do_IRQ().
    
    In timer_interrupt(), this sort of change will be necessary:
    
            -       update_process_times(user_mode(regs));
            -       profile_tick(CPU_PROFILING, regs);
            +       update_process_times(user_mode(get_irq_regs()));
            +       profile_tick(CPU_PROFILING);
    
    I'd like to move update_process_times()'s use of get_irq_regs() into itself,
    except that i386, alone of the archs, uses something other than user_mode().
    
    Some notes on the interrupt handling in the drivers:
    
     (*) input_dev() is now gone entirely.  The regs pointer is no longer stored in
         the input_dev struct.
    
     (*) finish_unlinks() in drivers/usb/host/ohci-q.c needs checking.  It does
         something different depending on whether it's been supplied with a regs
         pointer or not.
    
     (*) Various IRQ handler function pointers have been moved to type
         irq_handler_t.

    [PATCH] USB: OHCI on Compaq Aramada 7400
    
    This adds a quirk to the OHCI driver that lets it work with an old
    Compaq implementation.  It also removes some needless strings from
    the non-debug version of the driver.

commit 1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org>
Date:   Sat Apr 16 15:20:36 2005 -0700

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
