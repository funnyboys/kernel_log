    USB: misc: Use the correct style for SPDX License Identifier
    
    This patch corrects the SPDX License Identifier style in
    header files related to USB Miscellaneous drivers.
    For C header files Documentation/process/license-rules.rst
    mandates C-like comments (opposed to C source files where
    C++ style should be used).
    
    Changes made by using a script provided by Joe Perches here:

    USB: add SPDX identifiers to all remaining files in drivers/usb/
    
    It's good to have SPDX identifiers in all files to make it easier to
    audit the kernel tree for correct licenses.
    
    Update the drivers/usb/ and include/linux/usb* files with the correct
    SPDX license identifier based on the license text in the file itself.
    The SPDX identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which can be used
    instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This work is based on a script and data from Thomas Gleixner, Philippe
    Ombredanne, and Kate Stewart.

    This patch contains the following possible cleanups:
    - make needlessly global functions static

    - make SiS_VCLKData const
    - #if 0 the following unused global functions:
      - sisusb.c: sisusb_writew()
      - sisusb.c: sisusb_readw()
      - sisusb_init.c: SiSUSB_GetModeID()

    [PATCH] USB: sisusb[vga] update
    
    here is a new and extended version of the sisusbvga (previously: sisusb)
    driver. The patch is against 2.6.13 and updates the driver to version 0.0.8.
    
    Additions include complete VGA/EGA text console support and a build-in
    display mode infrastructure for userland applications that don't know
     about the graphics internals.
    
    Fixes include some BE/LE issues and a get/put_dev bug in the previous
    version.
    
    Other changes include a change of the module name from "sisusb" to
    "sisusbvga". The previous one was too generic IMHO.
    
    Please note that the patch also affects the Makefile in
    drivers/video/console as the driver requires the VGA 8x16 font in case
    the text console part is selected.
    
    Heavily tested, as usual. Please apply.
    
    One thing though: I already prepared for removal of the "mode" field and
    the changed "name" field in the usb_class_driver structure. This will
    perhaps need some refinement depending on whether you/Linus merge the
    respective core changes before or after 2.6.14.
