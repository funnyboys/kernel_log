    USB: serial: ftdi_sio: add support for FT232R CBUS gpios
    
    Enable support for cbus gpios on FT232R. The cbus configuration is
    stored in one word in the EEPROM at offset 0x0a (byte-offset 0x14) with
    the mux config for CBUS0, CBUS1, CBUS2 and CBUS3 in bits 0..3, 4..7,
    8..11 and 12..15, respectively.
    
    Tested using FT232RL by configuring one cbus pin at a time.

    USB: serial: ftdi_sio: implement GPIO support for FT-X devices
    
    This patch allows using the CBUS pins of FT-X devices as GPIO in CBUS
    bitbanging mode. There is no conflict between the GPIO and VCP
    functionality in this mode. Tested on FT230X and FT231X.
    
    As there is no way to request the current CBUS register configuration
    from the device, all CBUS pins are set to a known state when the first
    GPIO is requested. This allows using libftdi to set the GPIO pins
    before loading this module for UART functionality, a behavior that
    existing applications might be relying upon (though no specific case
    is known to the authors of this patch).

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd
Author: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 1 15:07:57 2017 +0100

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    USB: ftdi_sio: add support for FT-X series devices
    
    Add PID 0x6015, corresponding to the new series of FT-X chips
    (FT220XD, FT201X, FT220X, FT221X, FT230X, FT231X, FT240X).  They all
    appear as serial devices, and seem indistinguishable except for the
    default product string stored in their EEPROM.  The baudrate
    generation matches FT232RL devices.
    
    Tested with a FT201X and FT230X at various baudrates (100 - 3000000).

    appended patch adds support for the new FTDI FT232H chip. This chip is a
    single channel version of the dual FT2232H/quad FT4232H, coming with it's
    own default PID 0x6014 (FT2232H uses the same PID 0x6010 like FT2232C,
    FT4232H has also it's own PID).
    
    The patch was checked on an UM232H module and a terminal program with TX/RX
    shorted to that typing in the terminal reproduced the characters.

commit 31844d55800e1b93fe75c4d6188a4a44db2e1bbe
Author: Andreas Mohr <andi@lisas.de>
Date:   Wed Dec 16 21:45:10 2009 +0100

    USB: ftdi_sio: isolate all device IDs to new ftdi_sio_ids.h header
    
    This is a strictly move-only patch to relocate all FTDI device
    product ID definitions to their own ftdi_sio_ids.h header
    (following the usual *_ids.h kernel tree convention, too),
    thus correcting the slightly too messy appearance
    (crucial driver defines were stuck somewhere in the decaying middle swamp
    of the huge existing header).
    
    Compile-tested, based on latest mainline git.

    USB: ftdi: support NDI devices
    
    It enhances the driver for FTDI-based USB serial adapters to recognize and
    support Northern Digital Inc (NDI) measurement equipment. NDI has been
    providing this patch for various kernel flavors for several years and we would
    like to see these changes built in to the driver so that our equipement works
    without the need for customers to patch the kernel themselves.
    
    The patch makes small modifications to 2 files: ./drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.c
    and ./drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.h. It accomplishes 3 things:
    
    1. Define the VID and PIDs to allow the driver to recognize the NDI devices.
    2. Map the 19200 baud rate setting to our higher baud rate of 1.2Mb
       We would have chosen to map 38400 to the higher rate, similar to what
       several other vendors have done, but some of our legacy customers actually
       use 38400, therefore we remap 19200 to the higher rate.
    3. We set the default transmit latency in the FTDI chip to 1ms for our devices.
       Our devices are typically polled at 60Hz and the default ftdi latency
       seriously affects turn-around time and results in missed data frames. We
       have created a modprobe option that allows this setting to be increased.
       This has proven necessary particularly in some virtualized environments.

    It seems an USB device with vendor id 0403 and product code FB80 has an
    FTDI serial io chip as well: http://ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm
    This device in fact is a true random generantor by comsci:
    http://comscire.com/Products/R2000KU/
    So the following patch should add support for this device if I am
    correct. Not tested as I do not own this device (I would like support in
    the kernel so that my entropybroker application (which distributes
    entrop data (random values) between servers and clients)).

    USB: serial: FTDI: add high speed device support
    
    Added support for FTDI's USB 2.0 hi-speed devices - FT2232H (2
    interfaces) and FT4232H (4 interfaces), including a new baud rate
    calculation for these devices which can now achieve up to 12Mbaud by
    turning off a divide by 2.5 in the baud rate generator of the chips.  In
    order to achieve baud rates of <1200 baud, the divide by 2.5 must be
    active.  The default product ID of the FT2232H is 0x6010 (same as the
    FT2232C IC).  The default PID of the FT4232H is 0x6011.

    Add the identifiers for the Sprog II USB. This is a DCC control interface
    using the FTDI-SIO hardware: http://www.sprog-dcc.co.uk/. People have been
    using it with insmod options for ages, this just puts it into the driver

    USB: New device ID for ftdi_sio driver
    
    Here's a new device ID for the ftdio_sio driver.
    The diff is with linus's tree as of this morning.
    
    The device is the RigExpert Tiny USB Soundcard Transceiver Interface for ham
    radio.
    
    (I didn't actually test this. A fellow ham couldn't get the device to work, and
    I suggested binding the device ID using sysfs - see
    "http://jk.ufisa.uninett.no/usb/". However, he had had moved on to other things
    by then. I guess adding the device ID to the kernel "on spec" won't hurt.
    The relevant part of cat /proc/bus/usb/devices shows:

Author: Ray Molenkamp <rmolenkamp@matrixorbital.ca>
Date:   Wed May 21 17:06:26 2008 -0600

    USB: FTDI_SIO : Add support for Matrix Orbital PID Range
    
    This patch adds support for the range of PIDs
    that have been allocated for FTDI based devices
    at Matrix Orbital.
    
    A small number of units have been shipped early 2008
    with a faulty USB Descriptor.  Products that may have
    this issue have been marked with the existing quirk to
    work around the problem.

    USB: new ftdi_sio device id
    
    Here is a patch that adds support for the propox jtagcable II dongle
    (http://www.propox.com/products/t_117.html): their PID was missing,
    therefore we were not able to have the device recognized though it uses
    a standard FTDI chip.

commit 546d7eec389a3df3173b3131d92829c14e614601
Author: Kevin Vance <kvance@kvance.com>
Date:   Sat Mar 1 13:49:59 2008 -0500

    USB: ftdi_sio: Workaround for broken Matrix Orbital serial port
    
    Workaround for the FT232RL-based, Matrix Orbital VK204-25-USB serial port
    added to the ftdi_sio driver.
    
    The device has an invalid endpoint descriptor, which must be modified
    before it can be used.

    USB: ftdi_sio: Support for more JTAG adaptors
    
    [PATCH] ftdi_sio: add support for more FTDI based JTAG adaptors
    
    There are more devices similar to the Olimex JTAG adaptor, in that the first
    port of the FT2232C is used for JTAG, and only the second port is available as
    UART.
    
    I have thus renamed ftdi_olimex_{probe,quirk} to ftdi_jtag_{probe,quirk} and
    added vendor/product ID's for the OpenMoko Neo1973 Debug Board as well as the
    OOCDlink device.
    
    I've also updated the KERN_INFO message sent to userspace to remove the word
    'olimex' and an extra '\n' that was causing an empty line in dmesg.

    USB: ftdi_sio - enabling multiple ELV devices, adding EM1010PC
    
    I work with a group of people on a free home automation tool called
    FHEM.  Some of the users own more than one USB-serial device by ELV. The
    ftdi_sio driver has most of the ELV devices disabled by default and
    needs to be re-enabled every time you get a new kernel. Additionally a
    new device (EM 1010 PC - enegry monitor) is missing in the list.
    Currently our users have to follow the instructions we provide at
    http://www.koeniglich.de/fhem/linux.html ... However, to some users it
    is too complicated to compile their own kernel module.
    
    We are aware that you can specify one additional device using the
    vendor/product option of the module. But lot's of users own more than
    one device.

      The attached (mostly trivial) patches adds support for the Evolution
    Scorpion Robots.
      Evolution Robotics supplies a patch against 2.6.8 with their
    software. My patch is based on their work, so I don't know if I can
    sign it off, or if you need some Evolution people to do this (which
    might be hard).
      The patch adds device ID's for some robots which is trivial.

    USB: Product ID for FT232RL in ftdi_sio
    
    Here is a patch adding the PID for the FT232RL to ftdi_sio. The patch
    generates a warning during compilation because get_ftdi_divisor doesn't
    explicitly handle the FT232RL with this patch, so I guess you don't want
    to use it in its current state. It is all I could come up with with the
    knowledge I have of the drivers at the moment, though, and I hope you
    can have some use for it at least. It works fine with my DLP-TILT with
    an FT232RL.

    USB: add Additional PIDs in ftdi_sio
    
    I've developed some devices with FTDI chips (FT232xx). FTDI was so kind
    to give some own PID's which I can use together with their VID. Some of
    the devices are already very popular here and I have customers from
    universities, institutes .....
    
    I use the FTDI VID 0x0403. My PID's are:
    
    0xff38 - IBS US485 (USB<-->RS422/485 interface)
    0xff39 - IBS PIC-Programmer
    0xff3a - IBS Card reader for PCMCIA SRAM-cards
    0xff3b - IBS PK1 - Particel counter

    Please add a usb pid to the ftdi_sio driver. The pid is used by dmx4all
    dmx-interfaces (for stage lighting).
    
    The interfaces are using the usb-id 0403:c850. I added the id to the driver

    USB: add SeaLevel 2106 SeaLINK support to ftdi_sio
    
    We have a couple of these USB-Serial converters around; they're slightly
    different from the 2104 models in that they can handle 500Kb/sec over RS422.
    The existing ftdi driver seems to work just fine if we add in the
    appropriate IDs.
    
    Patch is against 2.6.17.6, but should apply cleanly to pretty much
    anything recent.

    [PATCH] USB: ftdi_sio: new IDs for Teratronik devices
    
    This patch adds vendor and product IDs to the ftdi_sio driver's device
    ID table for two devices from teratronik.de.  The device IDs were
    submitted by O. Wlfelschneider of Teratronik Elektronische Systeme
    GmbH.
    
    The charset of the patch is latin-1, same as the original files.
    
    Please apply, thanks!  (I've tried to avoid a clash with Andrew Morton's
    patch to add support for Posiflex PP-7700 printer to the same driver.)

    [PATCH] USB: Support for Posiflex PP-7000 retail printer in Linux
    
    This little patch adds recognition of Posiflex PP-7000 retail printer to
    ftdo_sio module. The printer uses FT232BM bridge programmed with custom
    VID/PID.  The patch posted to lkml and sf.net was for 2.6.11.1 kernel,
    here is one reworked for 2.6.12.

    [PATCH] USB: ftdi: Artemis and ATIK based USB astronomical CCD cameras
    
    This patch enables direct kernel support for the Artemis
    and ATIK astronomical based USB CCD cameras.
    Since all communications with this camera are done via an
    FTDI 245BM chip, it was only needed to specify the
    ProductID and VendorID of all three devices.
    In what tests are concerned, data was transfered from and
    to the FTDI at the chips Top speed (360KB/s).

    [PATCH] USB ftdi_sio: New IDs for ELV, Xsens and Falcom products
    
    This patch for the ftdi_sio driver adds a bunch of new devices and fixes
    an incorrect PID:
    
    o Fix PID for ELV UO100 (the PID was in fact for ELV UR100).
    o Add PID ELV UR100 (see above) and ELV ALC 8500 Expert.
    o Add a whole bunch of other PIDs for ELV USB devices, commented out for
       now as they may be used by other drivers eventually.  (Christian Abt
       of ELV.de submitted a full list of devices including an indication of
       which set of drivers are used by default in the MS Windows world.  We
       decided to comment out the devices that use FTDI's D2XX Windows
       drivers by default.)
    o Add PIDs for eight devices from Xsens Technologies BV (submitted in a
       patch against 2.6.12.2 by Patrick Riphagen).
    o Add PID for Falcom Samba GPRS modem (submitted by Sebastian Schubert).

commit 1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org>
Date:   Sat Apr 16 15:20:36 2005 -0700

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!

+ * - BaudDivisor is a fixed point number encoded in a funny way.
+ *   (--WRONG WAY OF THINKING--)
+ *   BaudDivisor is a fixed point number encoded with following bit weighs:
+ *   (-2)(-1)(13..0). It is a radical with a denominator of 4, so values
+ *   end with 0.0 (00...), 0.25 (10...), 0.5 (01...), and 0.75 (11...).
+ *   (--THE REALITY--)
+ *   The both-bits-set has quite different meaning from 0.75 - the chip designers
+ *   have decided it to mean 0.125 instead of 0.75.
+ *   This info looked up in FTDI application note "FT8U232 DEVICES \ Data Rates
+ *   and Flow Control Consideration for USB to RS232".
+ * - BaudDivisor = (BaseClock / 16) / BaudRate, where the (=) operation should
+ *   automagically re-encode the resulting value to take fractions into consideration.
+ * As all values are integers, some bit twiddling is in order:

+ * For the FT232BM, a 17th divisor bit was introduced to encode the multiples
+ * of 0.125 missing from the FT8U232AM.  Bits 16 to 14 are coded as follows
+ * (the first four codes are the same as for the FT8U232AM, where bit 16 is
+ * always 0):
+ *   000 - add .000 to divisor
+ *   001 - add .500 to divisor
+ *   010 - add .250 to divisor
+ *   011 - add .125 to divisor
+ *   100 - add .375 to divisor
+ *   101 - add .625 to divisor
+ *   110 - add .750 to divisor
+ *   111 - add .875 to divisor
+ * Bits 15 to 0 of the 17-bit divisor are placed in the urb value.  Bit 16 is 
+ * placed in bit 0 of the urb index.
+ *
+ * Note that there are a couple of special cases to support the highest baud
+ * rates.  If the calculated divisor value is 1, this needs to be replaced with
+ * 0.  Additionally for the FT232BM, if the calculated divisor value is 0x4001
+ * (1.5), this needs to be replaced with 0x0001 (1) (but this divisor value is
+ * not supported by the FT8U232AM).
