    USB: serial: Use the correct style for SPDX License Identifier
    
    This patch corrects the SPDX License Identifier style in
    header files related to USB Serial device configuration.
    For C header files Documentation/process/license-rules.rst
    mandates C-like comments (opposed to C source files where
    C++ style should be used).
    
    Changes made by using a script provided by Joe Perches here:

    USB: serial: Remove redundant license text
    
    Now that the SPDX tag is in all USB files, that identifies the license
    in a specific and legally-defined manner.  So the extra GPL text wording
    can be removed as it is no longer needed at all.
    
    This is done on a quest to remove the 700+ different ways that files in
    the kernel describe the GPL license text.  And there's unneeded stuff
    like the address (sometimes incorrect) for the FSF which is never
    needed.
    
    No copyright headers or other non-license-description text was removed.

    USB: add SPDX identifiers to all remaining files in drivers/usb/
    
    It's good to have SPDX identifiers in all files to make it easier to
    audit the kernel tree for correct licenses.
    
    Update the drivers/usb/ and include/linux/usb* files with the correct
    SPDX license identifier based on the license text in the file itself.
    The SPDX identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which can be used
    instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This work is based on a script and data from Thomas Gleixner, Philippe
    Ombredanne, and Kate Stewart.

commit 49cdee0ed0fce9e1bda81f5dcad8d5cce6aec983

    USB: oti6858 usb-serial driver (in Nokia CA-42 cable)
    
    Last week I've been searching for a driver for the CA-42 cable (see usb
     below) that fitted my kernel 2.6.20. I only found an abandoned version for a
     driver on your website that indeed worked on 2.6.18 but wouldn't even
     compile with a more recent 2.6.20 kernel.
    
    I fiddled 2 evenings with the kernel code and have patched it up now to work
    with the modifications in the 2.6.20 kernel. The patch is attached hereafter
    and it works fine (at least for me :-) ).
    
    Bus 2 Device 13: ID 0ea0:6858 Ours Technology, Inc.
    
    I had to fiddle a little with the settings in .gnokiirc but that also
     occurred with the older 2.6.18 kernel. Nevertheless, on one system with this
     cable and my Nokia 6070 I had best results with :
    
    model = 6510
    connection = dku5
    
    while on an other system with the same kernel, cable and phone it only worked
    with :
    
    model = AT
    connection = serial
    serial_write_usleep = 1
