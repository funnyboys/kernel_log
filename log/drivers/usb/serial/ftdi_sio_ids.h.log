    USB: serial: ftdi_sio: add device IDs for U-Blox C099-F9P
    
    This device presents itself as a USB hub with three attached devices:
     - An ACM serial port connected to the GPS module (not affected by this
       commit)
     - An FTDI serial port connected to the GPS module (1546:0502)
     - Another FTDI serial port connected to the ODIN-W2 radio module
       (1546:0503)
    
    This commit registers U-Blox's VID and the PIDs of the second and third
    devices.

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd
Author: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 1 15:07:57 2017 +0100

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    USB: serial: ftdi_sio: add Olimex ARM-USB-TINY(H) PIDs
    
    This patch adds support for recognition of ARM-USB-TINY(H) devices which
    are almost identical to ARM-USB-OCD(H) but lacking separate barrel jack
    and serial console.
    
    By suggestion from Johan Hovold it is possible to replace
    ftdi_jtag_quirk with a bit more generic construction. Since all
    Olimex-ARM debuggers has exactly two ports, we could safely always use
    only second port within the debugger family.

    USB: serial: ftdi_sio: add device ID for Microsemi/Arrow SF2PLUS Dev Kit
    
    This development kit has an FT4232 on it with a custom USB VID/PID.
    The FT4232 provides four UARTs, but only two are used. The UART 0
    is used by the FlashPro5 programmer and UART 2 is connected to the
    SmartFusion2 CortexM3 SoC UART port.
    
    Note that the USB VID is registered to Actel according to Linux USB
    VID database, but that was acquired by Microsemi.

    A Fedora user reports that the ftdi_sio driver works properly for the
    ICP DAS I-7561U device.  Further, the user manual for these devices
    instructs users to load the driver and add the ids using the sysfs
    interface.
    
    Add support for these in the driver directly so that the devices work
    out of the box instead of needing manual configuration.

    Steps: 2
    
    [ftdi_sio_ids.h]
    1. Defined the device PID
    
    [ftdi_sio.c]
    2. Added a macro declaration to the ids array, in order to enable the
    jtag quirk for the device.

    These product identifiers (PID) all deal with marine NMEA format data
    used on motor boats and yachts. We supply the programmed devices to
    Chetco, for use inside their equipment. The PIDs are a direct copy of
    our Windows device drivers (FTDI drivers with altered PIDs).

Author: Perry Hung <iperry@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Oct 22 23:31:34 2014 -0400

    usb: serial: ftdi_sio: add "bricked" FTDI device PID
    
    An official recent Windows driver from FTDI detects counterfeit devices
    and reprograms the internal EEPROM containing the USB PID to 0, effectively
    bricking the device.
    
    Add support for this VID/PID pair to correctly bind the driver on these
    devices.

    usb: ftdi_sio: Crucible Technologies COMET Caller ID - pid added
    
    Simple fix to add support for Crucible Technologies COMET Caller ID
    USB decoder - a device containing FTDI USB/Serial converter chip,
    handling 1200bps CallerID messages decoded from the phone line -
    adding correct USB PID is sufficient.
    
    Tested to apply cleanly and work flawlessly against 3.6.9, 3.7.0-rc8
    and 3.8.0-rc3 on both amd64 and x86 arches.

    USB: ftdi_sio: Add support for Newport AGILIS motor drivers
    
    The Newport AGILIS model AG-UC8 compact piezo motor controller
    (http://search.newport.com/?q=*&x2=sku&q2=AG-UC8)
    is yet another device using an FTDI USB-to-serial chip. It works
    fine with the ftdi_sio driver when adding
    
      options ftdi-sio product=0x3000 vendor=0x104d
    
    to modprobe.d. udevadm reports "Newport" as the manufacturer,
    and "Agilis" as the product name.

    USB: ftdi_sio: add TIAO USB Multi-Protocol Adapter (TUMPA) support
    
    TIAO/DIYGADGET USB Multi-Protocol Adapter (TUMPA) is an FTDI FT2232H
    based device which provides an easily accessible JTAG, SPI, I2C, serial
    breakout.
    
    http://www.diygadget.com/tiao-usb-multi-protocol-adapter-jtag-spi-i2c-serial.html
    http://www.tiaowiki.com/w/TIAO_USB_Multi_Protocol_Adapter_User%27s_Manual
    
    FTDI FT2232H provides two serial channels (A and B), but on the TUMPA
    channel A is dedicated to JTAG/SPI while channel B can be used for
    UART/RS-232: use the ftdi_jtag_quirk to expose only channel B as
    a usb-serial interface to userspace.

    USB: ftdi_sio: do not claim CDC ACM function
    
    The Microchip vid:pid 04d8:000a is used for their CDC ACM
    demo firmware application.  This is a device with a single
    function conforming to the CDC ACM specification and with
    the intention of demonstrating CDC ACM class firmware and
    driver interaction.  The demo is used on a number of
    development boards, and may also be used unmodified by
    vendors using Microchip hardware.
    
    Some vendors have re-used this vid:pid for other types of
    firmware, emulating FTDI chips. Attempting to continue to
    support such devices without breaking class based
    applications that by matching on interface
    class/subclass/proto being ff/ff/00.  I have no information
    about the actual device or interface descriptors, but this
    will at least make the proper CDC ACM devices work again.
    Anyone having details of the offending device's descriptors
    should update this entry with the details.

    USB: ftdi-sio: add support for more Physik Instrumente devices
    
    Commit b69cc672052540 added support for the E-861.  After acquiring a C-867, I
    realised that every Physik Instrumente's device has a different PID. They are
    listed in the Windows device driver's .inf file. So here are all PIDs for the
    current (and probably future) USB devices from Physik Instrumente.
    
    Compiled, but only actually tested on the E-861 and C-867.

    Add PID 0x6015, corresponding to the new series of FT-X chips
    (FT220XD, FT201X, FT220X, FT221X, FT230X, FT231X, FT240X).  They all
    appear as serial devices, and seem indistinguishable except for the
    default product string stored in their EEPROM.  The baudrate
    generation matches FT232RL devices.

    USB: Microchip VID mislabeled as Hornby VID in ftdi_sio.
    
    Microchip VID (0x04d8) was mislabeled as Hornby VID according to USB-IDs.
    
    A Full Speed USB Demo Board PID (0x000a) was mislabeled as
    Hornby Elite (an Digital Command Controller Console for model railways).
    
    Most likely the Hornby based their design on
    PIC18F87J50 Full Speed USB Demo Board.

    are not in latest 3.2 git.
    
    This adds IDs for the FTDI controller in the Rainforest Automation

    USB: ftdi_sio: Support TI/Luminary Micro Stellaris BD-ICDI Board
    
    Some Stellaris evaluation kits have the JTAG/SWD FTDI chip onboard,
    and some, like EK-LM3S9B90, come with a separate In-Circuit Debugger
    Interface Board. The ICDI board can also be used stand-alone, for
    other boards and chips than the kit it came with. The ICDI has both
    old style 20-pin JTAG connector and new style JTAG/SWD 10-pin 1.27mm
    pitch connector.
    
    Tested with EK-LM3S9B90, where the BD-ICDI board is included.

Author: Uwe Bonnes <bon@elektron.ikp.physik.tu-darmstadt.de>

    USB: Add new FT232H chip to drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.c
    
    appended patch adds support for the new FTDI FT232H chip. This chip is a
    single channel version of the dual FT2232H/quad FT4232H, coming with it's
    own default PID 0x6014 (FT2232H uses the same PID 0x6010 like FT2232C,
    FT4232H has also it's own PID).
    
    The patch was checked on an UM232H module and a terminal program with TX/RX
    shorted to that typing in the terminal reproduced the characters.

    I found the original patch on the db0fhn repeater wiki (couldn't find the email
    of the origial author) I guess it was never commited.
    I updated and added some Icom HAM-radio devices to the ftdi driver.
    Added extra comments to make clear what devices it are.

    have their own VID/PID, although they're using standard FTDI chip. In
    ftdi_sio.c, I also made small cleanup to have declarations for all
    Papouch devices together.

    USB: ftdi_sio: add product ID for Lenz LI-USB
    
    Add ftdi product ID for Lenz LI-USB, a model train interface.  This
    was NOT tested against 2.6.35, but a similar patch was tested with the
    CentOS 2.6.18-194.11.1.el5 kernel.  It wasn't clear to me what
    ordering is being used in ftdi_sio.c, so I inserted the ID after another
    model train entry(SPROG_II).

    This patch is to add a US Interface, Inc. "Navigator" USB device.
    Specifically, it's a HAM Radio USB sound modem that also
    incorporates three pairs of unique FTDI serial ports.  The standard
    Linux FTDI serial driver will only recognize the first two serial
    ports of an unknown FDTI derived device and this patch adds in
    recognition to these specific new IDs.

    USB: serial: enabling support for Segway RMP in ftdi_sio
    
    I have added the ProductID=0xe729 VendorID=FTDI_VID=0x0403 which will
    enable support for the Segway Robotic Mobility Platform (RMP200) in the
    ftdi_sio kernel module.  Currently, users of the Segway RMP200 must use
    a RUN+="/sbin/modprobe -q ftdi-sio product=0xe729 vendor=0x0403 in a
    udev rule to get the ftdi_sio module to handle the usb interface and
    mount it on /dev/ttyXXX.  This is not a good solution because some users
    will have multiple USB to Serial converters which will use the ftdi_sio
    module.

    USB: serial: ftdi: correct merge conflict with CONTEC id
    
    This patch corrects a problem with the merge of a previous
    patch to add the CONTEC identifier.
    
    I believe the merge problem occurred with the commit:
    dee5658b482e9e2ac7d6205dc876fc11d4008138
    
    Originally I submitted a patch and then they asked me to order the IDs
    and resubmit, so did I. But unfortunately in the end somehow both
    patches were merged.

    USB: ftdi_sio: add device IDs (several ELV, one Mindstorms NXT)
    
    - add FTDI device IDs for several ELV devices and NXTCam of Lego Mindstorms NXT
    - add hopefully helpful new_id comment
    - remove less helpful "Due to many user requests for multiple ELV devices we enable
      them by default." comment (we simply add _all_ known devices - an
      enduser shouldn't have to fiddle with obscure module parameters...).
    - add myself to DRIVER_AUTHOR
    
    The missing NXTCam ID has been found at
    http://www.unixboard.de/vb3/showthread.php?t=44155
    , ELV devices taken from ELV Windows .inf file.

    USB: ftdi_sio: new device id for papouch AD4USB
    
    added new device pid (PAPOUCH_AD4USB_PID) to ftdi_sio.h and ftdi_sio.c
    
    AD4USB measuring converter is a 4-input A/D converter which enables the
    user to measure to four current inputs ranging from 0(4) to 20 mA or
    voltage between 0 and 10 V. The measured values are then transferred to
    a superior system in digital form. The AD4USB communicates via USB.
    Powered is also via USB.  datasheet in english is here:

    USB: ftdi_sio: sort PID/VID entries in new ftdi_sio_ids.h header
    
    This is a (almost) sort-only patch to sort FTDI device
    product ID definitions in new ftdi_sio_ids.h header.
    
    Advantage is that new device ID submissions will now have a specific (sorted)
    position - less future merge conflicts.
    
    Compile-tested, based on _current_ mainline git.
    Minor checkpatch.pl warnings were eliminated whereever it made sense,
    very minor text changes.

commit 31844d55800e1b93fe75c4d6188a4a44db2e1bbe
Author: Andreas Mohr <andi@lisas.de>
Date:   Wed Dec 16 21:45:10 2009 +0100

    USB: ftdi_sio: isolate all device IDs to new ftdi_sio_ids.h header
    
    This is a strictly move-only patch to relocate all FTDI device
    product ID definitions to their own ftdi_sio_ids.h header
    (following the usual *_ids.h kernel tree convention, too),
    thus correcting the slightly too messy appearance
    (crucial driver defines were stuck somewhere in the decaying middle swamp
    of the huge existing header).
    
    Compile-tested, based on latest mainline git.
