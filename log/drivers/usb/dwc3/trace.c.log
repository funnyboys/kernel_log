    USB: dwc3: Remove redundant license text
    
    Now that the SPDX tag is in all USB files, that identifies the license
    in a specific and legally-defined manner.  So the extra GPL text wording
    can be removed as it is no longer needed at all.
    
    This is done on a quest to remove the 700+ different ways that files in
    the kernel describe the GPL license text.  And there's unneeded stuff
    like the address (sometimes incorrect) for the FSF which is never
    needed.
    
    No copyright headers or other non-license-description text was removed.

    USB: add SPDX identifiers to all remaining files in drivers/usb/
    
    It's good to have SPDX identifiers in all files to make it easier to
    audit the kernel tree for correct licenses.
    
    Update the drivers/usb/ and include/linux/usb* files with the correct
    SPDX license identifier based on the license text in the file itself.
    The SPDX identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which can be used
    instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This work is based on a script and data from Thomas Gleixner, Philippe
    Ombredanne, and Kate Stewart.

    usb: dwc3: add tracepoints to aid debugging
    
    When we're debugging hard-to-reproduce and time-sensitive
    use cases, printk() poses too much overhead. That's when
    the kernel's tracing infrastructure comes into play.
    
    This patch implements a few initial tracepoints for the
    dwc3 driver. More traces can be added as necessary in order
    to ease the task of debugging dwc3.
