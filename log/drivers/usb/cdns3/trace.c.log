    usb: cdns3: Add Cadence USB3 DRD Driver
    
    This patch introduce new Cadence USBSS DRD driver to Linux kernel.
    
    The Cadence USBSS DRD Controller is a highly configurable IP Core which
    can be instantiated as Dual-Role Device (DRD), Peripheral Only and
    Host Only (XHCI)configurations.
    
    The current driver has been validated with FPGA platform. We have
    support for PCIe bus, which is used on FPGA prototyping.
    
    The host side of USBSS-DRD controller is compliant with XHCI
    specification, so it works with standard XHCI Linux driver.
