    clk: sunxi-ng: h3: Export PLL_PERIPH0 clock for the PRCM
    
    The PRCM takes PLL_PERIPH0 as one of its parents for the AR100 clock.
    As such we need to be able to describe this relationship in the device
    tree.
    
    Export the PLL_PERIPH0 clock so we can reference it in the PRCM node.

    clk: sunxi-ng: add Allwinner H5 CCU support for H3 CCU driver
    
    Allwinner H5 is a SoC that features a design which keeps the peripheral
    compatible with H3, so that it have also a CCU like the one on H3 --
    only one bus gate/reset is added, and the mmc sample/output phases are
    removed because of MMC controller update.
    
    Add its support in our existing H3 CCU driver.
