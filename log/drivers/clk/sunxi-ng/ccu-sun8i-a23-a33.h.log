    clk: sunxi: a23/a33: Export the MIPI PLL
    
    The MIPI PLL is used for LVDS. Make sure it's exported in the dt bindings
    headers.

commit d05c748bd73015aa4aa10bafc178fc2be46a02cb
Author: Maxime Ripard <maxime.ripard@free-electrons.com>

    clk: sunxi-ng: Add A33 CCU support
    
    This commit introduces the clocks found in the Allwinner A33 CCU.
    
    Since this SoC is very similar to the A23, and we share a significant share
    of the DTSI, the clock IDs that are going to be used will also be shared
    with the A23, hence the name of the various header files.
