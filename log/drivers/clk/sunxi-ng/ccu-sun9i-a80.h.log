commit b8eb71dcdd0817ce75f2874301a068fb211dab41
Author: Chen-Yu Tsai <wens@csie.org>
Date:   Sat Jan 28 20:22:34 2017 +0800

    clk: sunxi-ng: Add A80 CCU
    
    Add support for the main clock unit found in the A80. Some clocks were
    not documented in the released user manual, but were found in the
    official kernel from Allwinner. These include controls for the I2S,
    SPDIF, SATA, and eDP blocks.
    
    Note that on the A80, some subsystems have separate clock controllers
    downstream of the main clock unit. These include the MMC, USB, and
    display engine subsystems.
