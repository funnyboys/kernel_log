    dt-bindings: clock: sun50i-a64-ccu: Add PLL_VIDEO0 macro
    
    Allwinner A64 HDMI PHY clock has PLL_VIDEO0 as a parent.
    
    Include the macro on dt-bindings so-that the same can be used
    while defining CCU clock phandles.

    clk: sunxi-ng: a64: Export PLL_PERIPH0 clock for the PRCM
    
    The PRCM takes PLL_PERIPH0 as one of its parents for the AR100 clock.
    As such we need to be able to describe this relationship in the device
    tree.
    
    Export the PLL_PERIPH0 clock so we can reference it in the PRCM node.
