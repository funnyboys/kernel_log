    clk: sunxi-ng: sun6i: Export video PLLs
    
    The 2x outputs of the 2 video PLL clocks are directly used by the
    HDMI controller block.
    
    Export them so they can be referenced in the device tree.

    clk: sunxi-ng: Add A31/A31s clocks
    
    Add a new style driver for the clock control unit in Allwinner A31/A31s.
    
    A few clocks are still missing:
    
        - MIPI PLL's HDMI mode support
        - EMAC clock
