commit 266061b7637b189ac82ee3a75116ff2dcb031e0b
Author: Icenowy Zheng <icenowy@aosc.io>

    clk: sunxi-ng: fix PRCM CCU CLK_NUMBER value
    
    The CLK_NUMBER value of PRCM CCU is wrongly set to (CLK_APB0_PWD + 1),
    which prevented the IR mod clock from being set up.
    
    Change it to (CLK_IR + 1) in order to correctly get IR mod set up.
