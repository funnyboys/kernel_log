    clk: bcm: Add BCM63138 clock support
    
    BCM63138 has a simple clocking domain which is primarily the ARMPLL
    clocking complex, from which the ARM (CPU), APB and AXI clocks would be
    derived from.
    
    Since the ARMPLL controller is entirely compatible with the iProc ARM
    PLL, we just initialize it without additional parameters.
