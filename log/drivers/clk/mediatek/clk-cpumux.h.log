commit 1e17de9049da5ef482ec8f6a875a83bec96bed3e
Author: Sean Wang <sean.wang@mediatek.com>

    clk: mediatek: add missing cpu mux causing Mediatek cpufreq can't work
    
    This patch adds CPU multiplexer clocks which are essential for Mediatek
    cpufreq driver. It would use the CPU clock multiplexer to switch to the
    intermediate clock source temporarily and then wait for the primary clock
    changing getting stable.
