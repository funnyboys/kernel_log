commit ba3fae06c7a4e80ab9d48a8a045b352da97cf23d
Author: Linus Walleij <linus.walleij@linaro.org>
Date:   Wed Feb 1 10:41:43 2017 +0100

    ARM/clk: move the ICST library to drivers/clk
    
    This moves the ICST clock divider helper library from
    arch/arm/common to drivers/clk/versatile so it is maintained
    with the other clock drivers.
    
    We keep the structure as a helper library intact and do not
    fuse it with the clk-icst.c Versatile ICST clock driver: there
    may be other users out there that need to use this library for
    their clocking, and then it will be helpful to keep the
    library contained. (The icst.[c|h] files could just be moved
    to drivers/clk/lib or a similar location to share the library.)
