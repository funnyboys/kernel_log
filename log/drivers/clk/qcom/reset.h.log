commit b36ba30c8ac66249915c57be101180cc58c42085

    clk: qcom: Add reset controller support
    
    Reset controllers and clock controllers are combined into one IP
    block on Qualcomm chipsets. Usually a reset signal is associated
    with each clock branch but sometimes a reset signal is associated
    with a handful of clocks. Either way the register interface is
    the same; set a bit to assert a reset and clear a bit to deassert
    a reset. Add support for these types of resets signals.
