commit f933d383df6b42e3262426d35593f18ff21aad57
Author: Abhishek Sahu <absahu@codeaurora.org>
Date:   Wed Dec 13 19:55:32 2017 +0530

    clk: qcom: add read-only divider operations
    
    Some of the divider settings are preconfigured and should not
    be changed by the clock framework during frequency change. This
    patch adds the read-only divider operation for QCOM dividers
    which is equivalent to generic divider operations in
    'commit 79c6ab509558 ("clk: divider: add CLK_DIVIDER_READ_ONLY flag")'.
