    clk: hisilicon: Remove clk.h include
    
    Clock provider drivers generally shouldn't include clk.h because
    it's the consumer API. Remove the include here because this is a
    provider driver. Also drop the clkdev.h include in files that
    aren't using it.

    clk: hisi: remove static variable
    
    Remove the static variable. So these common clock register helper could
    be used in more SoCs.
