    Update Viresh Kumar's email address
    
    Switch to my kernel.org alias instead of a badly named gmail address,
    which I rarely use.

    CLK: SPEAr: Correct index scanning done for clock synths
    
    The patch corrects the case when the rate table is being scanned for a
    given frequency, and the search frequency is beyond the maximum
    frequency indexed in the table.
    
    By default, the system should be set at max frequency present in the
    rate table. This patch correctly returns the corresponding index value.

commit 55b8fd4f428501b0f35d62b8313311fd9863c188

    SPEAr: clk: Add VCO-PLL Synthesizer clock
    
    All SPEAr SoC's contain PLLs. Their Fout is derived based on following equations
    
    - In normal mode
      vco = (2 * M[15:8] * Fin)/N
    
    - In Dithered mode
      vco = (2 * M[15:0] * Fin)/(256 * N)
    
    pll_rate = vco/2^p
    
    vco and pll are very closely bound to each other,
    "vco needs to program: mode, m & n" and "pll needs to program p",
    both share common enable/disable logic and registers.
    
    This patch adds in support for this type of clock.
