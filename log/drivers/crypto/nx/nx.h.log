    crypto: Replace zero-length array with flexible-array member
    
    The current codebase makes use of the zero-length array language
    extension to the C90 standard, but the preferred mechanism to declare
    variable-length types such as these ones is a flexible array member[1][2],
    introduced in C99:
    
    struct foo {
            int stuff;
            struct boo array[];
    };
    
    By making use of the mechanism above, we will get a compiler warning
    in case the flexible array does not occur last in the structure, which
    will help us prevent some kind of undefined behavior bugs from being
    inadvertently introduced[3] to the codebase from now on.
    
    Also, notice that, dynamic memory allocations won't be affected by
    this change:
    
    "Flexible array members have incomplete type, and so the sizeof operator
    may not be applied. As a quirk of the original implementation of
    zero-length arrays, sizeof evaluates to zero."[1]
    
    This issue was found with the help of Coccinelle.

    crypto: nx - don't abuse blkcipher_desc to pass iv around
    
    The NX crypto driver is using 'struct blkcipher_desc' to pass the IV
    around, even for AEADs (for which it creates the struct on the stack).
    This is not appropriate since this structure is part of the "blkcipher"
    API, which is deprecated and will be removed.
    
    Just pass around the IV directly instead.

    crypto: nx - no need to check return value of debugfs_create functions
    
    When calling debugfs functions, there is no need to ever check the
    return value.  The function can work or not, but the code logic should
    never do something different based on this.
    
    Also, there is no need to store the individual debugfs file names,
    especially as the whole directiry is deleted at once, so remove the
    unneeded structure entirely.

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    crypto: nx - Add forward declaration for struct crypto_aead
    
    The file nx.h has function prototypes that use struct crypto_aead.
    However, as crypto/aead.h is not included we don't have a definition
    for it.  This patch adds a forward declaration to fix this.

    crypto: nx - Removing CTR mode from NX driver
    
    CTR hardware implementation does not match with kernel spec causing a counter bug
    where just low 8 bytes are used for counter, when should be all 16bytes.
    
    Since we already have other counter modes working according with specs
    not worth to keep CTR itself on NX.

    crypto: nx - Fix reentrancy bugs
    
    This patch fixes a host of reentrancy bugs in the nx driver.  The
    following algorithms are affected:
    
    * CCM
    * GCM
    * CTR
    * XCBC
    * SHA256
    * SHA512
    
    The crypto API allows a single transform to be used by multiple
    threads simultaneously.  For example, IPsec will use a single tfm
    to process packets for a given SA.  As packets may arrive on
    multiple CPUs that tfm must be reentrant.
    
    The nx driver does try to deal with this by using a spin lock.
    Unfortunately only the basic AES/CBC/ECB algorithms do this in
    the correct way.
    
    The symptom of these bugs may range from the generation of incorrect
    output to memory corruption.

    crypto: nx - Fixing SHA update bug
    
    Bug happens when a data size less than SHA block size is passed.
    Since first attempt will be saved in buffer, second round attempt
    get into two step to calculate op.inlen and op.outlen. The issue
    resides in this step. A  wrong value of op.inlen and outlen was being
    calculated.
    
    This patch fix this eliminate the nx_sha_build_sg_list, that is
    useless in SHA's algorithm context. Instead we call nx_build_sg_list
    directly and pass a previous calculated max_sg_len to it.

    crypto: nx - Fixing the limit number of bytes to be processed
    
    The previous limits were estimated locally in a single step
    basead on bound values, however it was not correct since
    when given certain scatterlist the function nx_build_sg_lists
    was consuming more sg entries than allocated causing a
    memory corruption and crashes.
    
    e.g.: in the worst case we could have one sg entry for a single byte.
    
    This patch fixes it modifying the logic of the bound limit
    moving it to nx_sg_build_lists and set a correct sg_max limit,
    adding a trim function to ensure the bound in sg_list. Also fixing
    nx_build_sg_list  NULL and untreated return in case of overflow.

    crypto: nx - fix concurrency issue
    
    The NX driver uses the transformation context to store several fields
    containing data related to the state of the operations in progress.
    Since a single tfm can be used by different kernel threads at the same
    time, we need to protect the data stored into the context.
    
    This patch makes use of spin locks to protect the data where a race
    condition can happen.
