commit 6e88098ca43a3d80ae86908f7badba683c8a0d84

    crypto: crypto4xx - Fix wrong ppc4xx_trng_probe()/ppc4xx_trng_remove() arguments
    
    When building without CONFIG_HW_RANDOM_PPC4XX, I hit the following build failure:
    drivers/crypto/amcc/crypto4xx_core.c: In function 'crypto4xx_probe':
    drivers/crypto/amcc/crypto4xx_core.c:1407:20: error: passing argument 1 of 'ppc4xx_trng_probe' from incompatible pointer type [-Werror=incompatible-pointer-types]
    In file included from drivers/crypto/amcc/crypto4xx_core.c:50:0:
    drivers/crypto/amcc/crypto4xx_trng.h:28:20: note: expected 'struct crypto4xx_device *' but argument is of type 'struct crypto4xx_core_device *'
    drivers/crypto/amcc/crypto4xx_core.c: In function 'crypto4xx_remove':
    drivers/crypto/amcc/crypto4xx_core.c:1434:21: error: passing argument 1 of 'ppc4xx_trng_remove' from incompatible pointer type [-Werror=incompatible-pointer-types]
    In file included from drivers/crypto/amcc/crypto4xx_core.c:50:0:
    drivers/crypto/amcc/crypto4xx_trng.h:30:20: note: expected 'struct crypto4xx_device *' but argument is of type 'struct crypto4xx_core_device *'
    
    This patch fix the needed argument of ppc4xx_trng_probe()/ppc4xx_trng_remove() in that case.

    crypto4xx: integrate ppc4xx-rng into crypto4xx
    
    This patch integrates the ppc4xx-rng driver into the existing
    crypto4xx. This is because the true random number generator
    is controlled and part of the security core.
