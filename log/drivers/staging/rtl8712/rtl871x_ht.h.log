    staging: rtl8712: add SPDX identifiers
    
    This satisfies a checkpatch warning and is the preferred
    method for notating the license.
    
    The SPDX identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which
    can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.

commit 2865d42c78a9121caad52cb02d1fbb7f5cdbc4ef
Author: Larry Finger <Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net>
Date:   Fri Aug 20 10:15:30 2010 -0500

    staging: r8712u: Add the new driver to the mainline kernel
    
    This code is for a completely new version of the Realtek 8192 USB devices
    such as the D-Link DWA-130. The Realtek code, which was originally for
    Linux, Windows XP and Windows CE, has been stripped of all code not needed
    for Linux. In addition, only one additional configuration variable, which
    enables AP mode, remains.
