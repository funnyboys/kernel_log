    staging: rtl8192u: add proper SPDX identifiers on files that did not have them.
    
    There were a few files for the rtl8192u driver that did not have SPDX
    identifiers on them, so fix that up.  At the same time, remove the "free
    form" text that specified the license of the file, as that is impossible
    for any tool to properly parse.

    staging: rtl8192u: make r8192_wx_handlers_def structure const
    
    Make this const as it is only stored in a const field of a pci_dev
    structure. Make the declaration in the header const too.
    
    Structure found using Coccinelle and changes done by hand.

    Staging: rtl8192u: remove a copy of 80211.h
    
    We had a request to enable one of the realtek network drivers in staging in Fedora.
    After a quick lookover, I decided this wasn't such a great idea.
    
    In doing so though, I noticed we have 6 copies of ieee80211.h there now,
    Two drivers even have two copies of it.  (Even worse, cleanups have been pointlessly
    happening to both files).  The patch below removes one of them, which is asides
    from whitespace, identical afaics. With a change of filename to the #include,
    it all still compiles for me.
    
    A better fix would be to remove both, and have them use the core ieee80211 stuff,
    but this is at least a tiny step in the right direction.
