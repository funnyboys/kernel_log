commit fa590c222fbaa428edb2ce2194638906cea1400a

    staging: rts5208: add support for rts5208 and rts5288
    
    There are still many rts5208/5288 card readers being used, but no
    drivers are supported them in kernel now. This driver can make a
    great convenience for people who use them.
    
    Many other rts-series card reader are supported by mfd driver, but due
    to much difference with others, rts5208/5288 can not add into mfd driver
    pretty now, so we provide a separated driver here to support the device.
