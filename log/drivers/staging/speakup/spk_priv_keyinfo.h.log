    staging: speakup: remove redundant license text
    
    Now that the SPDX tag is in all drivers/staging/speakup/ files, that
    identifies the license in a specific and legally-defined manner.  So the
    extra GPL text wording can be removed as it is no longer needed at all.
    
    This is done on a quest to remove the 700+ different ways that files in
    the kernel describe the GPL license text.  And there's unneeded stuff
    like the address (sometimes incorrect) for the FSF which is never
    needed.
    
    No copyright headers or other non-license-description text was removed.

commit 6496922817e1a1cba8a2d9939ca5de53c5d55239
Author: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>
Date:   Thu Jan 11 11:08:40 2018 +0100

    staging: speakup: add SPDX identifier.
    
    It's good to have SPDX identifiers in all files to make it easier to
    audit the kernel tree for correct licenses.
    
    Fix up the remaining staging speakup files to have a proper SPDX
    identifier, based on the license text in the file itself.  The SPDX
    identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which can be used instead of
    the full boiler plate text.
    
    This work is based on a script and data from Thomas Gleixner, Philippe
    Ombredanne, and Kate Stewart.
