    staging: rtl8192e: add proper SPDX identifiers on files that did not have them.
    
    There were a few files for the rtl8192e driver that did not have SPDX
    identifiers on them, so fix that up.  At the same time, remove the "free
    form" text that specified the license of the file, as that is impossible
    for any tool to properly parse.

commit 3d461c912462b6b36ff9cf2c2f605ef37aeab438
Author: Sean MacLennan <seanm@seanm.ca>

    rtl8192e: Split into two directories
    
    Now that the rtl8192e driver is split up, it makes sense to keep the
    rtllib code in one directory and the rtl8192e specific code in
    another. This patch contains the split and the fixup of includes.
    
    Since rtl_core.h already included rtllib.h and dot11d.h, rtl_core.h
    was updated to point to the parent directory. All other references to
    rtllib.h and dot11d.h in the rtl8192e specific code where deleted
    rather than fixed. This leaves just one file that needs to know the
    real location of the rtllib includes.
