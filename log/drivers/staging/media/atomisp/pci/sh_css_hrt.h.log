    media: atomisp: add SPDX headers
    
    This driver is licensed under GPL 2.0, as stated inside their
    headers.
    
    Add the proper tag there. We should probably latter cleanup
    the reduntant licensing text, but this could be done later,
    after we get rid of other abstraction layers.

    media: atomisp: get rid of non-Linux error codes
    
    The atomisp driver has its own error codes under the
    ia_css_err.h file. On several places, those got already
    replaced by standard error codes, but there are still a
    lot more to be fixed.
    
    Let's get rid of all of those, mapping them into
    the already-existing set of Linux error codes.

    media: atomisp: cleanup directory hierarchy
    
    This driver has very long directories without a good
    reason (IMHO). Let's drop two directories from such hierarchy,
    in order to simplify things a little bit and make the dir
    output a bit more readable.
