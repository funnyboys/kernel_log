    media: atomisp: add SPDX headers
    
    This driver is licensed under GPL 2.0, as stated inside their
    headers.
    
    Add the proper tag there. We should probably latter cleanup
    the reduntant licensing text, but this could be done later,
    after we get rid of other abstraction layers.

    media: atomisp: remove some file duplication and do more dir renames
    
    There are currently two identical copies of some files, one
    at css_2401_csi2p_system/ and another one at css_2401_system/.
    
    Get rid of one of them, moving the remaining files to the
    directory with the shortest name.
    
    While here, do more renames, in order to get smaller path
    names.
