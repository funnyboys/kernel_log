    media: atomisp: add SPDX headers
    
    This driver is licensed under GPL 2.0, as stated inside their
    headers.
    
    Add the proper tag there. We should probably latter cleanup
    the reduntant licensing text, but this could be done later,
    after we get rid of other abstraction layers.

    media: atomisp: do lots of other coding style cleanups
    
    Use some auto-reformat tools to make the atomisp style
    a little better. There are still lots of weird things there,
    but this will hopefully reduce the number of pure coding
    style patches submitted upstream.

    Revert "media: staging: atomisp: Remove driver"
    
    There are some interest on having this driver back, and I
    can probably dedicate some time to address its issue. So,
    let's ressurect it.
    
    For now, the driver causes a recursive error and doesn't
    build, so, make it depend on BROKEN.
    
    This reverts commit 51b8dc5163d2ff2bf04019f8bf7e3bd0e75bb654.

    media: staging: atomisp: Remove driver
    
    The atomisp driver has a long list of todo items and little has been done
    to address these lately while more has been added. The driver is also not
    functional. In other words, the driver would not be getting out of staging
    in the foreseeable future. At the same time it consumes developer
    resources in order to maintain the flaky code base. Remove it.

commit a49d25364dfb9f8a64037488a39ab1f56c5fa419
Author: Alan Cox <alan@linux.intel.com>
Date:   Fri Feb 17 16:55:17 2017 +0000

    staging/atomisp: Add support for the Intel IPU v2
    
    This patch adds support for the Intel IPU v2 as found on Android and IoT
    Baytrail-T and Baytrail-CR platforms (those with the IPU PCI mapped). You
    will also need the firmware files from your device (Android usually puts
    them into /etc) - or you can find them in the downloadable restore/upgrade
    kits if you blew them away for some reason.
    
    It may be possible to extend the driver to handle the BYT/T windows
    platforms such as the ASUS T100TA. These platforms don't expose the IPU via
    the PCI interface but via ACPI buried in the GPU description and with the
    camera information somewhere unknown so would need a platform driver
    interface adding to the codebase *IFF* the firmware works on such devices.
    
    To get good results you also need a suitable support library such as
    libxcam. The camera is intended to be driven from Android so it has a lot of
    features that many desktop apps don't fully spport.
    
    In theory all the pieces are there to build it with -DISP2401 and some
    differing files to get CherryTrail/T support, but unifying the drivers
    properlly is a work in progress.
    
    The IPU driver represents the work of a lot of people within Intel over many
    years. It's historical goal was portability rather than Linux upstream. Any
    queries about the upstream aimed driver should be sent to me not to the
    original authors.
