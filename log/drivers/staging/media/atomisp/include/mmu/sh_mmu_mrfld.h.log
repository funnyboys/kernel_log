    media: atomisp: add SPDX headers
    
    This driver is licensed under GPL 2.0, as stated inside their
    headers.
    
    Add the proper tag there. We should probably latter cleanup
    the reduntant licensing text, but this could be done later,
    after we get rid of other abstraction layers.

    media: atomisp: cleanup directory hierarchy
    
    This driver has very long directories without a good
    reason (IMHO). Let's drop two directories from such hierarchy,
    in order to simplify things a little bit and make the dir
    output a bit more readable.
