    Staging: Netlogic: Move all the netdev under single parent device
    
    XLR has one network controller and XLS has two network controllers, each
    controller has 4 gmac devices. This patch initializes each controller as
    a parent device and the four gmac devices of a controller are connected
    to the parent controller as a child
