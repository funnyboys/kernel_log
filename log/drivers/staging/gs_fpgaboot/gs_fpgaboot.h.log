    staging: gs_fpgaboot: add SPDX identifiers
    
    This satisfies a checkpatch warning and is the preferred
    method for notating the license.
    
    The SPDX identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which
    can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.

    staging: gs_fpgaboot: change char to u8
    
    The bitstream storage variables were changed from char to u8 arrays to
    prevent issues such as negative lengths. This change makes the code
    compatible with the "data" field in "struct firmware" which is of type
    u8.

    scripts/spelling.txt: add "followings" pattern and fix typo instances
    
    Fix typos and add the following to the scripts/spelling.txt:
    
      followings||following
    
    While we are here, add a missing colon in the boilerplate in DT binding
    documents.  The "you SoC" in allwinner,sunxi-pinctrl.txt was fixed as
    well.
    
    I reworded "as the followings:" to "as follows:" for
    drivers/usb/gadget/udc/renesas_usb3.c.

    staging: gs_fpgaboot: Remove FSF address from GPL notice
    
    This patch fixes the checkpatch.pl warning:
    
    CHECK: Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software
    Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF has
    changed addresses in the past, and may do so again. Linux already
    includes a copy of the GPL.
