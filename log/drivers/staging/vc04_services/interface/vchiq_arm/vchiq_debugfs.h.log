    staging: vc04_services: Replace VCHIQ_INSTANCE_T typedef with struct vchiq_instance
    
    Replaces  VCHIQ_INSTANCE_T typedef with struct vchiq_instance to match
    kernel code style. Issue found by checkpatch.
    
    Additionally, as part of the process renames "struct vchiq_instance_struct" to "struct vchiq_instance".

    staging: vc04_services: remove remaining redundant license text
    
    Now that the SPDX tag is in all vc04_services files, that identifies the
    license in a specific and legally-defined manner.  So the extra GPL and
    BSD text wording can be removed as it is no longer needed at all.
    
    This is done on a quest to remove the 700+ different ways that files in
    the kernel describe the license text.
    
    No copyright headers or other non-license-description text was removed.

    There are a number of vc04_services files that are dual licensed under

    identifier on them, so fix that up and add the proper identifier so that
    tools can pick it up easily.

    staging: vc04_services: no need to check debugfs return values
    
    When calling debugfs functions, there is no need to ever check the
    return value.  The function can work or not, but the code logic should
    never do something different based on this.
    
    Clean up the vchiq_arm code by not caring about the value of debugfs
    calls.  This ends up removing a number of lines of code that are not
    needed.

    VCHIQ: Make service closure fully synchronous (drv)
    
    This is one half of a two-part patch, the other half of which is to
    the vchiq_lib user library. With these patches, calls to
    vchiq_close_service and vchiq_remove_service won't return until any
    associated callbacks have been delivered to the callback thread.
    
    VCHIQ: Add per-service tracing
    
    The new service option VCHIQ_SERVICE_OPTION_TRACE is a boolean that
    toggles tracing for the specified service.
    
    This commit also introduces vchi_service_set_option and the associated
    option VCHI_SERVICE_OPTION_TRACE.
    
    vchiq: Make the synchronous-CLOSE logic more tolerant
    
    vchiq: Move logging control into debugfs
    
    vchiq: Take care of a corner case tickled by VCSM
    
    Closing a connection that isn't fully open requires care, since one
    side does not know the other side's port number. Code was present to
    handle the case where a CLOSE is sent immediately after an OPEN, i.e.
    before the OPENACK has been received, but this was incorrectly being
    used when an OPEN from a client using port 0 was rejected.
    
    (In the observed failure, the host was attempting to use the VCSM
    service, which isn't present in the 'cutdown' firmware. The failure
    was intermittent because sometimes the keepalive service would
    grab port 0.)
    
    This case can be distinguished because the client's remoteport will
    still be VCHIQ_PORT_FREE, and the srvstate will be OPENING. Either
    condition is sufficient to differentiate it from the special case
    described above.
    
    vchiq: Avoid high load when blocked and unkillable
    
    vchiq: Include SIGSTOP and SIGCONT in list of signals not-masked by vchiq to allow gdb to work
    
    vchiq_arm: Complete support for SYNCHRONOUS mode
    
    vchiq: Remove inline from suspend/resume
    
    vchiq: Allocation does not need to be atomic
    
    vchiq: Fix wrong condition check
    
    The log level is checked from within the log call. Remove the check in the call.

    vchiq_arm: Two cacheing fixes
    
    1) Make fragment size vary with cache line size
    Without this patch, non-cache-line-aligned transfers may corrupt
    (or be corrupted by) adjacent data structures.
    
    Both ARM and VC need to be updated to enable this feature. This is
    ensured by having the loader apply a new DT parameter -
    cache-line-size. The existence of this parameter guarantees that the
    kernel is capable, and the parameter will only be modified from the
    safe default if the loader is capable.
    
    2) Flush/invalidate vmalloc'd memory, and invalidate after reads

            if (fd < 0)
                    err(1, "open failed");
