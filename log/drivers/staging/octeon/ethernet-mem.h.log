    Revert "staging: octeon: delete driver"
    
    This reverts commit 710d7fbe21ee2ceab121f1f84a20edf68f9f9742.
    Re-instate the code so subsequent commits can clean it up and get it
    building properly.

    staging: octeon: delete driver
    
    This driver has been in the tree since 2009 with no real movement to get
    it out.  Now it is starting to cause build issues and other problems for
    people who want to fix coding style problems, but can not actually build
    it.
    
    As nothing is happening here, just delete the module entirely.

    staging: octeon: remove redundant license text
    
    Now that the SPDX tag is in all drivers/staging/octeon/ files, that
    identifies the license in a specific and legally-defined manner.  So the
    extra GPL text wording can be removed as it is no longer needed at all.
    
    This is done on a quest to remove the 700+ different ways that files in
    the kernel describe the GPL license text.  And there's unneeded stuff
    like the address (sometimes incorrect) for the FSF which is never
    needed.
    
    No copyright headers or other non-license-description text was removed.

    staging: octeon: add SPDX identifiers.
    
    It's good to have SPDX identifiers in all files to make it easier to
    audit the kernel tree for correct licenses.
    
    Fix up the staging octeon driver to have a proper SPDX identifier, based
    on the license text in the file itself.  The SPDX identifier is a
    legally binding shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler
    plate text.
    
    This work is based on a script and data from Thomas Gleixner, Philippe
    Ombredanne, and Kate Stewart.

    Staging: Add octeon-ethernet driver files.
    
    The octeon-ethernet driver supports the sgmii, rgmii, spi, and xaui
    ports present on the Cavium OCTEON family of SOCs.  These SOCs are
    multi-core mips64 processors with existing support over in arch/mips.
    
    The driver files can be categorized into three basic groups:
    
    1) Register definitions, these are named cvmx-*-defs.h
    
    2) Main driver code, these have names that don't start cvmx-.
    
    3) Interface specific functions and other utility code, names starting
    with cvmx-
