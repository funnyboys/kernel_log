    staging: sm750fb: fix odd license text
    
    There is some "confusing" license text in some of the sm750fb driver
    files.  After discussing it with the company, it turns out to have been
    a mistake and these lines can be safely removed.  The files are all to
    be licensed under the GPLv2 license.

    staging: sm750fb: add proper SPDX identifier to driver
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.  Because of this, add the
    GPL-2.0 identifier to the sm750fb driver which did not have any license
    identifiers in it at all.

commit efe9bc08bf479b1baacc63554042c5dd11fecd9e

    staging: sm750fb: Merge ddk750_help.* into ddk750_chip.*.
    
    The file ddk750_help.c contained only one function declaration,
    so it was merged into ddk750_chip.c to simplify the driver.
    
    Also, ddk750_help.h was merged into ddk750_chip.h to keep consistency.
    
    With these changes a few global variables are removed and the function
    ddk750_set_mmio is rewritten, so its purpose in the code is clearer.
