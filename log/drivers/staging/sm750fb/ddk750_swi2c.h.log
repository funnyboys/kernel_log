    staging: sm750fb: fix odd license text
    
    There is some "confusing" license text in some of the sm750fb driver
    files.  After discussing it with the company, it turns out to have been
    a mistake and these lines can be safely removed.  The files are all to
    be licensed under the GPLv2 license.

    staging: sm750fb: add proper SPDX identifier to driver
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.  Because of this, add the
    GPL-2.0 identifier to the sm750fb driver which did not have any license
    identifiers in it at all.

    staging: sm750fb: fix length of lines, function calls and declaration
    
    This patch breaks lines that are longer than 80 characters and joins
    together those, that are too short and can be placed at one.
    
    Function calls and declarations are updated to fit kernel code style.
