    staging: rtl8188eu: add SPDX identifiers
    
    This satisfies a checkpatch warning and is the preferred
    method for notating the license.
    
    The SPDX identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which
    can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.

Author: Kyle Kuffermann <kyle.kuffermann@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Mar 13 10:16:27 2016 -0400

    staging: rtl8188eu: Remove license paragraph with mailing address
    
    This fixes the issue reported by checkpatch.pl:
    
            "Do not include the paragraph about writing to the Free Software
            Foundation's mailing address from the sample GPL notice. The FSF
            has changed addresses in the past, and may do so again.  Linux
            already includes a copy of the GPL."
    
    in all files for the rtl8188eu driver.
