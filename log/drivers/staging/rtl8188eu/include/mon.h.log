    staging: rtl8188eu: add SPDX identifiers
    
    This satisfies a checkpatch warning and is the preferred
    method for notating the license.
    
    The SPDX identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which
    can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.

    staging: rtl8188eu: Introduce monitor interface for IEEE 802.11 frames
    
    This adds support for monitoring IEEE 802.11 Data and Management frames
    received or transmitted by a RTL8188EU-based device handled by this
    driver.
    
    The monitor interface is not enabled by default and will be registered
    only if monitor_enable module parameter is set to 1.  When enabled it
    will show up as a monX network device, which can be used by the
    userspace programs for monitoring network traffic.
    
    It is intended as an exploratory/debugging tool for rtl8188eu driver.
