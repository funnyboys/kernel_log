commit 475be4d85a274d0961593db41cf85689db1d583c
Author: Joe Perches <joe@perches.com>
Date:   Sun Feb 19 19:52:38 2012 -0800

    isdn: whitespace coding style cleanup
    
    isdn source code uses a not-current coding style.
    
    Update the coding style used on a per-line basis
    so that git diff -w shows only elided blank lines
    at EOF.
    
    Done with emacs and some scripts and some typing.
    
    Built x86 allyesconfig.
    No detected change in objdump -d or size.
