    md/raid1: Replace zero-length array with flexible-array
    
    The current codebase makes use of the zero-length array language
    extension to the C90 standard, but the preferred mechanism to declare
    variable-length types such as these ones is a flexible array member[1][2],
    introduced in C99:
    
    struct foo {
            int stuff;
            struct boo array[];
    };
    
    By making use of the mechanism above, we will get a compiler warning
    in case the flexible array does not occur last in the structure, which
    will help us prevent some kind of undefined behavior bugs from being
    inadvertently introduced[3] to the codebase from now on.
    
    Also, notice that, dynamic memory allocations won't be affected by
    this change:
    
    "Flexible array members have incomplete type, and so the sizeof operator
    may not be applied. As a quirk of the original implementation of
    zero-length arrays, sizeof evaluates to zero."[1]
    
    sizeof(flexible-array-member) triggers a warning because flexible array
    members have incomplete type[1]. There are some instances of code in
    which the sizeof operator is being incorrectly/erroneously applied to
    zero-length arrays and the result is zero. Such instances may be hiding
    some bugs. So, this work (flexible-array member conversions) will also
    help to get completely rid of those sorts of issues.
    
    This issue was found with the help of Coccinelle.

commit 935fe0983e09f4f7331ebf5ea4ae2124f6e9f9e8

    md: rename some drivers/md/ files to have an "md-" prefix
    
    Motivated by the desire to illiminate the imprecise nature of
    DM-specific patches being unnecessarily sent to both the MD maintainer
    and mailing-list.  Which is born out of the fact that DM files also
    reside in drivers/md/
    
    Now all MD-specific files in drivers/md/ start with either "raid" or
    "md-" and the MAINTAINERS file has been updated accordingly.
    
    Shaohua: don't change module name
