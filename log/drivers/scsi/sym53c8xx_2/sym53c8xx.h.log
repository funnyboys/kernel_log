commit a44131b35ec1a46ed75014d818cb9d5706117b49
Author: Matthew Wilcox <matthew@wil.cx>

    [SCSI] sym53c8xx: Remove tag_ctrl module parameter
    
    With sysfs making these options tunable at runtime, there's no
    justification for keeping this horrendously complex specification
    string around.

commit 1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
