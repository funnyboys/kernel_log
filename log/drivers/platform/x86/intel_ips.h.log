    platform/x86: intel-ips: Use the correct style for SPDX License Identifier
    
    This patch corrects the SPDX License Identifier style in
    header files related to x86 Platform Specific Drivers.
    For C header files Documentation/process/license-rules.rst
    mandates C-like comments (opposed to C source files where
    C++ style should be used).
    
    Changes made by using a script provided by Joe Perches here:
    https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/2/7/46.

commit 63ee41d794d9c555f84205517a68509848988760
Author: Eric Anholt <eric@anholt.net>

    drm/i915, intel_ips: When i915 loads after IPS, make IPS relink to i915.
    
    The IPS driver is designed to be able to run detached from i915 and
    just not enable GPU turbo in that case, in order to avoid module
    dependencies between the two drivers.  This means that we don't know
    what the load order between the two is going to be, and we had
    previously only supported IPS after (optionally) i915, but not i915
    after IPS.  If the wrong order was chosen, you'd get no GPU turbo, and
    something like half the possible graphics performance.
