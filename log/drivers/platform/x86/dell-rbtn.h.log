    change email address for Pali Rohár
    
    For security reasons I stopped using gmail account and kernel address is
    now up-to-date alias to my personal address.
    
    People periodically send me emails to address which they found in source
    code of drivers, so this change reflects state where people can contact
    me.

commit b05ffc95f9ed986534b67538e239e9c4ba254b55
Author: Pali Rohár <pali.rohar@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Jun 6 10:23:29 2015 +0200

    dell-rbtn: Export notifier for other kernel modules
    
    This patch exports notifier functions so other modules can receive HW
    switch events. By default when some module register notifier, dell-rbtn
    driver automatically remove rfkill interfaces from system (it is expected
    that other module will use events for other rfkill interface). This
    behaviour can be changed with new module parameter "auto_remove_rfkill".
    
    This patch is designed for dell-laptop module for receiving those events.
