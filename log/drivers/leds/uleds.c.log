commit c5bf68fe0c86a5835bd2e6aead1c49976360753f
Author: Kirill Smelkov <kirr@nexedi.com>
Date:   Tue Mar 26 23:51:19 2019 +0300

    *: convert stream-like files from nonseekable_open -> stream_open
    
    Using scripts/coccinelle/api/stream_open.cocci added in 10dce8af3422
    ("fs: stream_open - opener for stream-like files so that read and write
    can run simultaneously without deadlock"), search and convert to
    stream_open all in-kernel nonseekable_open users for which read and
    write actually do not depend on ppos and where there is no other methods
    in file_operations which assume @offset access.
    
    I've verified each generated change manually - that it is correct to convert -
    and each other nonseekable_open instance left - that it is either not correct
    to convert there, or that it is not converted due to current stream_open.cocci
    limitations. The script also does not convert files that should be valid to
    convert, but that currently have .llseek = noop_llseek or generic_file_llseek
    for unknown reason despite file being opened with nonseekable_open (e.g.
    drivers/input/mousedev.c)
    
    Among cases converted 14 were potentially vulnerable to read vs write deadlock
    (see details in 10dce8af3422):

    and the rest were just safe to convert to stream_open because their read and
    write do not use ppos at all and corresponding file_operations do not
    have methods that assume @offset file access(*):

    (*) This second group also contains cases with read/write deadlocks that
    stream_open.cocci don't yet detect, but which are still valid to convert to
    stream_open since ppos is not used. For example drivers/pci/switch/switchtec.c
    calls wait_for_completion_interruptible() in its .read, but stream_open.cocci
    currently detects only "wait_event*" as blocking.

commit a9a08845e9acbd224e4ee466f5c1275ed50054e8

    vfs: do bulk POLL* -> EPOLL* replacement
    
    This is the mindless scripted replacement of kernel use of POLL*
    variables as described by Al, done by this script:
    
        for V in IN OUT PRI ERR RDNORM RDBAND WRNORM WRBAND HUP RDHUP NVAL MSG; do
            L=`git grep -l -w POLL$V | grep -v '^t' | grep -v /um/ | grep -v '^sa' | grep -v '/poll.h$'|grep -v '^D'`
            for f in $L; do sed -i "-es/^\([^\"]*\)\(\<POLL$V\>\)/\\1E\\2/" $f; done
        done
    
    with de-mangling cleanups yet to come.
    
    NOTE! On almost all architectures, the EPOLL* constants have the same
    values as the POLL* constants do.  But they keyword here is "almost".
    For various bad reasons they aren't the same, and epoll() doesn't
    actually work quite correctly in some cases due to this on Sparc et al.
    
    The next patch from Al will sort out the final differences, and we
    should be all done.

commit e381322b0190c1253d347de3f28b5c37756fb651
Author: David Lechner <david@lechnology.com>

    leds: Introduce userspace LED class driver
    
    This driver creates a userspace leds driver similar to uinput.
    
    New LEDs are created by opening /dev/uleds and writing a uleds_user_dev
    struct. A new LED class device is registered with the name given in the
    struct. Reading will return a single byte that is the current brightness.
    The poll() syscall is also supported. It will be triggered whenever the
    brightness changes. Closing the file handle to /dev/uleds will remove
    the leds class device.
