    HID: Fix assumption that devices have inputs
    
    The syzbot fuzzer found a slab-out-of-bounds write bug in the hid-gaff
    driver.  The problem is caused by the driver's assumption that the
    device must have an input report.  While this will be true for all
    normal HID input devices, a suitably malicious device can violate the
    assumption.
    
    The same assumption is present in over a dozen other HID drivers.
    This patch fixes them by checking that the list of hid_inputs for the
    hid_device is nonempty before allowing it to be used.

    HID: use hid_hw_request() instead of direct call to usbhid
    
    This allows the hid drivers to be independent from the transport layer.
    
    The patch was constructed by replacing all occurences of
    usbhid_submit_report() by its hid_hw_request() counterpart.
    Then, drivers not requiring USB_HID anymore have their USB_HID
    dependency cleaned in the Kconfig file.
    
    Finally, few drivers still depends on USB_HID. Many of them
    are requiring the io wait callback. They are found in the next patch.

    HID: Use module_hid_driver macro
    
    Use the new module_hid_driver macro in all HID drivers that have
    a simple register/unregister init/exit.
    
    This also converts the hid drivers that test for a failure of
    hid_register_driver() and report the failure. Using module_hid_driver
    in those drivers removes the failure message.

commit 5a0e3ad6af8660be21ca98a971cd00f331318c05
Author: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>

    include cleanup: Update gfp.h and slab.h includes to prepare for breaking implicit slab.h inclusion from percpu.h
    
    percpu.h is included by sched.h and module.h and thus ends up being
    included when building most .c files.  percpu.h includes slab.h which
    in turn includes gfp.h making everything defined by the two files
    universally available and complicating inclusion dependencies.
    
    percpu.h -> slab.h dependency is about to be removed.  Prepare for
    this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those
    headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion
    needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is
    used as the basis of conversion.
    
      http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py
    
    The script does the followings.
    
    * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that
      only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,
      gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.
    
    * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include
      blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms
      to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains
      core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -
      alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there
      doesn't seem to be any matching order.
    
    * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly
      because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out
      an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the
      file.
    
    The conversion was done in the following steps.
    
    1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly
       over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h
       and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400
       files.
    
    2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,
       some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or
       embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added
       inclusions to around 150 files.
    
    3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits
       from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.
    
    4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.
       e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab
       APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.
    
    5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically
       editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h
       files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h
       inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually
       wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each
       slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as
       necessary.
    
    6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.
    
    7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures
       were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my
       distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few
       more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things
       build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).
    
       * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.
       * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig
       * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig
       * ia64 SMP allmodconfig
       * s390 SMP allmodconfig
       * alpha SMP allmodconfig
       * um on x86_64 SMP allmodconfig
    
    8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as
       a separate patch and serve as bisection point.
    
    Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step
    6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch.
    If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch
    headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of
    the specific arch.

    HID: fix hid-ff drivers so that devices work even without ff support
    
    Currently, the hid-*ff force feedback drivers, which claim the blacklisted
    device on a HID bus, are only compiled in if the user selects force feedback
    support.
    
    However we want the device to be supported even when the kernel is configured
    without force feedback.
    
    This patch fixes the drivers in a way that they get compiled even if force
    feedback is turned off; all the force feedback support code is compiled out in
    such case, and the driver works as a usual driver on HID bus, claiming and
    initializing the device, making it operational without FF effects.

    HID: remove compat stuff
    
    This removal was scheduled and there is no problem with later
    distros to adapt for the new bus, thanks to aliases.
    
    module-init-tools map files are deprecated nowadays, so that
    the patch which introduced hid ones into the m-i-t won't be
    accepted and hence there is no reason for leaving compat stuff in.
