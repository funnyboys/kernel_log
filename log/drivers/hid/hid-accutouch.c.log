commit c846fe9ce90a5ab0329de7f08d7523fb58c1251e
Author: Martyn Welch <martyn.welch@collabora.co.uk>
Date:   Tue Feb 14 14:17:56 2017 +0000

    HID: Accutouch: Add driver for ELO Accutouch 2216 USB Touchscreens
    
    The Accutouch 2216 is reporting BTN_LEFT/BTN_MOUSE rather than BTM_TOUCH
    in it's capabilities, which is what user space expects a touchscreen
    device to report. This is causing udev to consider the device to be a
    "VMware's USB mouse" rather than as a touchscreen, which results in a
    mouse cursor being displayed in Weston.
    
    This patch adds a special driver for the device to correct the
    capabilities reported.
