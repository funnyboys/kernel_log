    HID: elecom: add support for EX-G M-XT4DRBK trackball
    
    This patch enables the 6th button on the ELECOM EX-G M-XT4DRBK
    trackball mouse.
    
    This is a left handed EX-G variant which only comes in a wireless (D)
    model. It has a total of 6 buttons but one of these is not available
    because of how the HID descriptor is configured.

    HID: elecom: refer to trackballs by model name instead of series
    
    This patch changes all references to ELECOM trackballs using their
    series name to refer to them by their model name.
    
    ELECOM provides multiple series of mice such as EX-G, HUGE, and DEFT.
    Although it has not caused conflicts in the driver, there can be more
    than one iteration of mice in each series. For example, there are 7
    variants of EX-G trackballs but only three (M-XT3URBK, M-XT3DRBK, and
    M-XT4DRBK) need a driver to work correctly.
    
    There are also 4 DEFT series trackballs but two of them have the same
    VID:PID as the other two. I picked the earlier model for the naming of
    the PID macros.

    HID: elecom: rewrite report fixup for EX-G and future mice
    
    This patch rewrites the mouse report fixup used for the DEFT and HUGE
    elecom trackballs in order to make it generic enough to fix other
    elecom mice with similar issues. This patch also uses this new report
    fixup function to fix the Elecom EX-G trackball which has 6 physical
    buttons and a similar issue to the other two mice.
    
    Elecom's track record has so far shown that they like to re-use the
    same report descriptor for multiple different mice regardless of the
    number of buttons the mouse has. This means that the missing buttons
    on multiple mice can be fixed in one function without introducing
    phantom buttons which would in turn cause the number of mouse buttons
    to be misreported to userspace.
    
    This patch drops the very verbose report descriptor "diff" comment for
    a more abridged yet hopefully just as informative generic version.

    HID: hid-elecom: extend to fix descriptor for HUGE trackball
    
    In addition to DEFT, Elecom introduced a larger trackball called HUGE, in
    both wired (M-HT1URBK) and wireless (M-HT1DRBK) versions. It has the same
    buttons and behavior as the DEFT. This patch adds the two relevant USB IDs
    to enable operation of the three Fn buttons on the top of the device.

    HID: elecom: extend to fix the descriptor for DEFT trackballs
    
    The ELECOM DEFT trackballs report only five buttons, when the device
    actually has 8. Change the descriptor so that the HID driver can see all of
    them.
    
    For completeness and future reference, I included a side-by-side diff of
    the part of the descriptor that is being edited.

    HID: Use module_hid_driver macro
    
    Use the new module_hid_driver macro in all HID drivers that have
    a simple register/unregister init/exit.
    
    This also converts the hid drivers that test for a failure of
    hid_register_driver() and report the failure. Using module_hid_driver
    in those drivers removes the failure message.

    HID: Add and use hid_<level>: dev_<level> equivalents
    
    Neaten current uses of dev_<level> by adding and using
    hid specific hid_<level> macros.
    
    Convert existing uses of dev_<level> uses to hid_<level>.
    Convert hid-pidff printk uses to hid_<level>.
    
    Remove err_hid and use hid_err instead.
    
    Add missing newlines to logging messages where necessary.
    Coalesce format strings.
    
    Add and use pr_fmt(fmt) KBUILD_MODNAME ": " fmt
    
    Other miscellaneous changes:
    
    Add const struct hid_device * argument to hid-core functions
    extract() and implement() so hid_<level> can be used by them.
    Fix bad indentation in hid-core hid_input_field function
    that calls extract() function above.

    HID: allow resizing and replacing report descriptors
    
    Update hid_driver's report_fixup prototype to allow changing report
    descriptor size and/or returning completely different report descriptor.
    Update existing usage accordingly.
    
    This is to give more freedom in descriptor fixup and to allow having a whole
    fixed descriptor in the code for the sake of readability.
