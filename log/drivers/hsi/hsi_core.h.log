    HSI: hsi: Introducing HSI framework
    
    Adds HSI framework in to the linux kernel.
    
    High Speed Synchronous Serial Interface (HSI) is a
    serial interface mainly used for connecting application
    engines (APE) with cellular modem engines (CMT) in cellular
    handsets.
    
    HSI provides multiplexing for up to 16 logical channels,
    low-latency and full duplex communication.
