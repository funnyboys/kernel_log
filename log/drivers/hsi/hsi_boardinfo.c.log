commit de7c98eb7c6f72bbfa87afc5b7e2d3b0188a8d83

    HSI: Use kcalloc() in hsi_register_board_info()
    
    A multiplication for the size determination of a memory allocation
    indicated that an array data structure should be processed.
    Thus use the corresponding function "kcalloc".
    
    This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.

    HSI: hsi: Introducing HSI framework
    
    Adds HSI framework in to the linux kernel.
    
    High Speed Synchronous Serial Interface (HSI) is a
    serial interface mainly used for connecting application
    engines (APE) with cellular modem engines (CMT) in cellular
    handsets.
    
    HSI provides multiplexing for up to 16 logical channels,
    low-latency and full duplex communication.
