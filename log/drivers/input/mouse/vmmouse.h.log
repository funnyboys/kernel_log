    Input: psmouse - drop all unneeded functions from mouse headers
    
    Recently we had a building error if we enable the MOUSE_PS2_ALPS while
    disable the MOUSE_PS2_TRACKPOINT, and was fixed by 49e6979e7e92
    ("Input: psmouse - fix build error of multiple definition").
    
    We could improve that fix by dropping all unneeded functions and
    CONFIG_MOUSE_ guards from the header, it is safe to do that since
    those functions are not directly called by psmouse-base.c anymore.

commit 8b8be51b4fd365ac5983e117be9d28f427a07b68
Author: Thomas Hellstrom <thellstrom@vmware.com>
Date:   Tue Apr 14 10:06:38 2015 -0700

    Input: add vmmouse driver
    
    VMMouse enables low-latency mouse-cursor-movements for VMWare and QEMU
    guests.  By removing the guest cursor and using the host as a guest cursor
    the cursor movement appears instant although in reality there is some lag.
    To be able to do this, the host's view of the cursor position must exactly
    match the guest's view and an absolute pointer device is needed. Enter the
    VMMouse. While the VMMouse driver has historically been an Xorg user-space
    driver, implementing it as a kernel imput driver enables rootless Xorg and
    new compositing display servers for VMware guests.
