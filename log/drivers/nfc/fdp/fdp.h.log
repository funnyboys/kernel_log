    NFC: Add Intel Fields Peak NFC solution driver
    
    Fields Peak complies with the ISO/IEC 14443A/B, 15693, 18092,
    and JIS X 6319-4. It is an NCI based controller.
    
    RF Protocols supported:
     - NFC Forum Type 1 Tags (Jewel, Topaz)
     - NFC Forum Type 2 Tags (Mifare UL)
     - NFC Forum Type 3 Tags (FeliCa)
     - NFC Forum Type 4A (ISO/IEC 14443 A-4 106kbps to 848kbps)
     - NFC Forum Type 4B (ISO/IEC 14443 B-4 106kbps to 848kbps)
     - NFCIP in passive and active modes (ISO/IEC 18092 106kbps
       to 424kbps)
     - Bâ€™ (based on ISO/IEC 14443 B-2)
     - iCLASS (based on ISO/IEC 15693-2)
     - Vicinity cards (ISO/IEC 15693-3)
     - Kovio tags (NFC Forum Type 2)
    
    The device can be enumerated using ACPI using the id INT339A.
    The 1st GPIO is the IRQ and the 2nd is the RESET pin.
