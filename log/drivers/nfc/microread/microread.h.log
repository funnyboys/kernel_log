commit 98b32decc83ed3137e3ddbc918b102f8fc406b6d
Author: Jeff Kirsher <jeffrey.t.kirsher@intel.com>

    nfc: Fix FSF address in file headers
    
    Several files refer to an old address for the Free Software Foundation
    in the file header comment.  Resolve by replacing the address with
    the URL <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/> so that we do not have to keep
    updating the header comments anytime the address changes.
