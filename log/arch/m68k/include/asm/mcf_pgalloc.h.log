    m68k: mm: Change ColdFire pgtable_t
    
    To match what we did to the Motorola MMU routines, change the ColdFire
    pgalloc.
    
    The result is that ColdFire and Sun3 pgalloc are actually very similar
    and could conceivably be unified.

    m68k: mm: Remove stray nocache in ColdFire pgalloc
    
    Since ColdFire V4e is a software TLB-miss architecture, there is no
    need for page-tables to be mapped uncached. Remove this stray
    nocache_page() dance, which isn't paired with a cache_page() and looks
    like a copy/paste/edit fail.

    m68k: mm: use pgtable-nopXd instead of 4level-fixup
    
    m68k has two or three levels of page tables and can use appropriate
    pgtable-nopXd and folding of the upper layers.
    
    Replace usage of include/asm-generic/4level-fixup.h and explicit
    definitions of __PAGETABLE_PxD_FOLDED in m68k with
    include/asm-generic/pgtable-nopmd.h for two-level configurations and
    with include/asm-generic/pgtable-nopud.h for three-lelve configurations
    and adjust page table manipulation macros and functions accordingly.

    mm: treewide: clarify pgtable_page_{ctor,dtor}() naming
    
    The naming of pgtable_page_{ctor,dtor}() seems to have confused a few
    people, and until recently arm64 used these erroneously/pointlessly for
    other levels of page table.
    
    To make it incredibly clear that these only apply to the PTE level, and to
    align with the naming of pgtable_pmd_page_{ctor,dtor}(), let's rename them
    to pgtable_pte_page_{ctor,dtor}().
    
    These changes were generated with the following shell script:
    
    ----
    git grep -lw 'pgtable_page_.tor' | while read FILE; do
        sed -i '{s/pgtable_page_ctor/pgtable_pte_page_ctor/}' $FILE;
        sed -i '{s/pgtable_page_dtor/pgtable_pte_page_dtor/}' $FILE;
    done
    ----
    
    ... with the documentation re-flowed to remain under 80 columns, and
    whitespace fixed up in macros to keep backslashes aligned.
    
    There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.

    mm: treewide: remove unused address argument from pte_alloc functions
    
    Patch series "Add support for fast mremap".
    
    This series speeds up the mremap(2) syscall by copying page tables at
    the PMD level even for non-THP systems.  There is concern that the extra
    'address' argument that mremap passes to pte_alloc may do something
    subtle architecture related in the future that may make the scheme not
    work.  Also we find that there is no point in passing the 'address' to
    pte_alloc since its unused.  This patch therefore removes this argument
    tree-wide resulting in a nice negative diff as well.  Also ensuring
    along the way that the enabled architectures do not do anything funky
    with the 'address' argument that goes unnoticed by the optimization.
    
    Build and boot tested on x86-64.  Build tested on arm64.  The config
    enablement patch for arm64 will be posted in the future after more
    testing.
    
    The changes were obtained by applying the following Coccinelle script.
    (thanks Julia for answering all Coccinelle questions!).
    Following fix ups were done manually:
    * Removal of address argument from  pte_fragment_alloc
    * Removal of pte_alloc_one_fast definitions from m68k and microblaze.
    
    // Options: --include-headers --no-includes
    // Note: I split the 'identifier fn' line, so if you are manually
    // running it, please unsplit it so it runs for you.

    Fix by calling pgtable_page_dtor() in our __pte_free_tlb() code path,
    so that the PG_table flag is cleared before we free the pte page.
    
    Note that I had to change the type of pte_free() to be static from
    extern. Otherwise you get a lot of warnings like this:
    
    ./arch/m68k/include/asm/mcf_pgalloc.h:80:2: warning: ‘pgtable_page_dtor’ is static but used in inline function ‘pte_free’ which is not static
      pgtable_page_dtor(page);
      ^
    
    And making it static is consistent with our use of this in the other
    m68k pgalloc definitions of pte_free().

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    tree wide: get rid of __GFP_REPEAT for order-0 allocations part I
    
    This is the third version of the patchset previously sent [1].  I have
    basically only rebased it on top of 4.7-rc1 tree and dropped "dm: get
    rid of superfluous gfp flags" which went through dm tree.  I am sending
    it now because it is tree wide and chances for conflicts are reduced
    considerably when we want to target rc2.  I plan to send the next step
    and rename the flag and move to a better semantic later during this
    release cycle so we will have a new semantic ready for 4.8 merge window
    hopefully.
    
    Motivation:
    
    While working on something unrelated I've checked the current usage of
    __GFP_REPEAT in the tree.  It seems that a majority of the usage is and
    always has been bogus because __GFP_REPEAT has always been about costly
    high order allocations while we are using it for order-0 or very small
    orders very often.  It seems that a big pile of them is just a
    copy&paste when a code has been adopted from one arch to another.
    
    I think it makes some sense to get rid of them because they are just
    making the semantic more unclear.  Please note that GFP_REPEAT is
    documented as
    
    * __GFP_REPEAT: Try hard to allocate the memory, but the allocation attempt
    
    * _might_ fail.  This depends upon the particular VM implementation.
      while !costly requests have basically nofail semantic.  So one could
      reasonably expect that order-0 request with __GFP_REPEAT will not loop
      for ever.  This is not implemented right now though.
    
    I would like to move on with __GFP_REPEAT and define a better semantic
    for it.
    
      $ git grep __GFP_REPEAT origin/master | wc -l
      111
      $ git grep __GFP_REPEAT | wc -l
      36
    
    So we are down to the third after this patch series.  The remaining
    places really seem to be relying on __GFP_REPEAT due to large allocation
    requests.  This still needs some double checking which I will do later
    after all the simple ones are sorted out.
    
    I am touching a lot of arch specific code here and I hope I got it right
    but as a matter of fact I even didn't compile test for some archs as I
    do not have cross compiler for them.  Patches should be quite trivial to
    review for stupid compile mistakes though.  The tricky parts are usually
    hidden by macro definitions and thats where I would appreciate help from
    arch maintainers.
    
    [1] http://lkml.kernel.org/r/1461849846-27209-1-git-send-email-mhocko@kernel.org
    
    This patch (of 19):
    
    __GFP_REPEAT has a rather weak semantic but since it has been introduced
    around 2.6.12 it has been ignored for low order allocations.  Yet we
    have the full kernel tree with its usage for apparently order-0
    allocations.  This is really confusing because __GFP_REPEAT is
    explicitly documented to allow allocation failures which is a weaker
    semantic than the current order-0 has (basically nofail).
    
    Let's simply drop __GFP_REPEAT from those places.  This would allow to
    identify place which really need allocator to retry harder and formulate
    a more specific semantic for what the flag is supposed to do actually.
