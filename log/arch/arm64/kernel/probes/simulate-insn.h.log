commit 39a67d49ba353630d144a8eb775500c041c89e7a

    arm64: kprobes instruction simulation support
    
    Kprobes needs simulation of instructions that cannot be stepped
    from a different memory location, e.g.: those instructions
    that uses PC-relative addressing. In simulation, the behaviour
    of the instruction is implemented using a copy of pt_regs.
    
    The following instruction categories are simulated:
     - All branching instructions(conditional, register, and immediate)
     - Literal access instructions(load-literal, adr/adrp)
    
    Conditional execution is limited to branching instructions in
    ARM v8. If conditions at PSTATE do not match the condition fields
    of opcode, the instruction is effectively NOP.
    
    Thanks to Will Cohen for assorted suggested changes.
