    mm/vmalloc: Add empty <asm/vmalloc.h> headers and use them from <linux/vmalloc.h>
    
    In the x86 MM code we'd like to untangle various types of historic
    header dependency spaghetti, but for this we'd need to pass to
    the generic vmalloc code various vmalloc related defines that
    customarily come via the <asm/page.h> low level arch header.
