    arm/arm64: xen: Move shared architecture headers to include/xen/arm
    
    ARM and arm64 Xen ports share a number of headers, leading to
    packaging issues when these headers needs to be exported, as it
    breaks the reasonable requirement that an architecture port
    has self-contained headers.
    
    Fix the issue by moving the 5 header files to include/xen/arm,
    and keep local placeholders to include the relevant files.

    arm64/xen: introduce asm/xen header files on arm64
    
    asm/xen/hypercall.h, asm/xen/hypervisor.h, asm/xen/interface.h and
    asm/xen/page.h are identical so to avoid code duplication we are just
    including the original arm header files here.
    
    asm/xen/events.h is slightly different, so introduce a different file
    here (use xchg to implement xchg_xen_ulong and pass regs->pstate to
    raw_irqs_disabled_flags).
    
    Also introduce asm/hypervisor.h and asm/sync_bitops.h.
