commit fc47897d2c65bc94b6868a5c914afbd33216e26f
Author: Catalin Marinas <catalin.marinas@arm.com>

    arm64: Device specific operations
    
    This patch adds several definitions for device communication, including
    I/O accessors and ioremap(). The __raw_* accessors are implemented as
    inline asm to avoid compiler generation of post-indexed accesses (less
    efficient to emulate in a virtualised environment).
