    arm64: add kconfig symbol to configure physical address size
    
    ARMv8.2 introduces support for 52-bit physical addresses. To prepare for
    supporting this, add a new kconfig symbol to configure the physical
    address space size. The symbols will be used in subsequent patches.
    Currently the only choice is 48, a later patch will add the option of 52
    once the required code is in place.

    arm64: mm: update max pa bits to 48
    
    Now that we support 48-bit physical addressing, update MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS
    accordingly.

    arm64: MMU definitions
    
    The virtual memory layout is described in
    Documentation/arm64/memory.txt. This patch adds the MMU definitions for
    the 4KB and 64KB translation table configurations. The SECTION_SIZE is
    2MB with 4KB page and 512MB with 64KB page configuration.
    
    PHYS_OFFSET is calculated at run-time and stored in a variable (no
    run-time code patching at this stage).
    
    On the current implementation, both user and kernel address spaces are
    512G (39-bit) each with a maximum of 256G for the RAM linear mapping.
    Linux uses 3 levels of translation tables with the 4K page configuration
    and 2 levels with the 64K configuration. Extending the memory space
    beyond 39-bit with the 4K pages or 42-bit with 64K pages requires an
    additional level of translation tables.
    
    The SPARSEMEM configuration is global to all AArch64 platforms and
    allows for 1GB sections with SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP enabled by default.
