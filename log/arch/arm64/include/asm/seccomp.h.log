commit a1ae65b219416a72c15577bd4c8c11174fffbb8b
Author: AKASHI Takahiro <takahiro.akashi@linaro.org>

    arm64: add seccomp support
    
    secure_computing() is called first in syscall_trace_enter() so that
    a system call will be aborted quickly without doing succeeding syscall
    tracing if seccomp rules want to deny that system call.
    
    On compat task, syscall numbers for system calls allowed in seccomp mode 1
    are different from those on normal tasks, and so _NR_seccomp_xxx_32's need
    to be redefined.
