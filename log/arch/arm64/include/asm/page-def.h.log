commit b6531456ba279bb7cea5dd2e7b3ec6a3ed0f4668
Author: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>
Date:   Fri Jul 14 19:43:56 2017 +0100

    arm64: factor out PAGE_* and CONT_* definitions
    
    Some headers rely on PAGE_* definitions from <asm/page.h>, but cannot
    include this due to potential circular includes. For example, a number
    of definitions in <asm/memory.h> rely on PAGE_SHIFT, and <asm/page.h>
    includes <asm/memory.h>.
    
    This requires users of these definitions to include both headers, which
    is fragile and error-prone.
    
    This patch ameliorates matters by moving the basic definitions out to a
    new header, <asm/page-def.h>. Both <asm/page.h> and <asm/memory.h> are
    updated to include this, avoiding this fragility, and avoiding the
    possibility of circular include dependencies.
