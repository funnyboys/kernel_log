    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with no license
    
    Many user space API headers are missing licensing information, which
    makes it hard for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default are files without license information under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPLV2.  Marking them GPLV2 would exclude
    them from being included in non GPLV2 code, which is obviously not
    intended. The user space API headers fall under the syscall exception
    which is in the kernels COPYING file:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    otherwise syscall usage would not be possible.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with an SPDX
    license identifier.  The chosen identifier is 'GPL-2.0 WITH
    Linux-syscall-note' which is the officially assigned identifier for the
    Linux syscall exception.  SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.

    arm64: uid16: fix __kernel_old_{gid,uid}_t definitions
    
    Whilst native arm64 applications don't have the 16-bit UID/GID syscalls
    wired up, compat tasks can still access them. The 16-bit wrappers for
    these syscalls use __kernel_old_uid_t and __kernel_old_gid_t, which must
    be 16-bit data types to maintain compatibility with the 16-bit UIDs used
    by compat applications.
    
    This patch defines 16-bit __kernel_old_{gid,uid}_t types for arm64
    instead of using the 32-bit types provided by asm-generic.
