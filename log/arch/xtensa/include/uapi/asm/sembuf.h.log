    arch: sembuf.h: make uapi asm/sembuf.h self-contained
    
    Userspace cannot compile <asm/sembuf.h> due to some missing type
    definitions.  For example, building it for x86 fails as follows:
    
        CC      usr/include/asm/sembuf.h.s
      In file included from <command-line>:32:0:

        __kernel_ulong_t __unused4;
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    It is just a matter of missing include directive.
    
    Include <asm/ipcbuf.h> to make it self-contained, and add it to
    the compile-test coverage.

    y2038: xtensa: Extend sysvipc data structures
    
    xtensa, uses a nonstandard variation of the generic sysvipc
    data structures, intended to have the padding moved around
    so it can deal with big-endian 32-bit user space that has
    64-bit time_t.
    
    xtensa tries hard to define the structures so they work
    in both big-endian and little-endian systems with padding
    on the right side.
    However, they only succeeded for for two of the three structures,
    and their struct shmid64_ds ended up being defined in two
    identical copies, and the big-endian one is wrong.
    
    This takes just take the same approach here that we have for
    the asm-generic headers and adds separate 32-bit fields for the
    upper halves of the timestamps, to let libc deal with the mess
    in user space.

commit e2be04c7f9958dde770eeb8b30e829ca969b37bb

    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with a license
    
    Many user space API headers have licensing information, which is either
    incomplete, badly formatted or just a shorthand for referring to the
    license under which the file is supposed to be.  This makes it hard for
    compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    Update these files with an SPDX license identifier.  The identifier was
    chosen based on the license information in the file.
    
    GPL/LGPL licensed headers get the matching GPL/LGPL SPDX license
    identifier with the added 'WITH Linux-syscall-note' exception, which is
    the officially assigned exception identifier for the kernel syscall
    exception:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    This exception makes it possible to include GPL headers into non GPL
    code, without confusing license compliance tools.
    
    Headers which have either explicit dual licensing or are just licensed
    under a non GPL license are updated with the corresponding SPDX
    identifier and the GPLv2 with syscall exception identifier.  The format
    is:
            ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR SPDX-ID-OF-OTHER-LICENSE)
    
    SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding shorthand, which can be
    used instead of the full boiler plate text.  The update does not remove
    existing license information as this has to be done on a case by case
    basis and the copyright holders might have to be consulted. This will
    happen in a separate step.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.
