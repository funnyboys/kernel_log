    xtensa: move headers files to arch/xtensa/include
    
    Move all header files for xtensa to arch/xtensa/include and platform and
    variant header files to the appropriate arch/xtensa/platforms/ and
    arch/xtensa/variants/ directories.
    
    Moving the files gets also rid of all uses of symlinks in the Makefile.
    
    This has been completed already for the majority of the architectures
    and xtensa is one out of six missing.
