    riscv: abstract out CSR names for supervisor vs machine mode
    
    Many of the privileged CSRs exist in a supervisor and machine version
    that are used very similarly.  Provide versions of the CSR names and
    fields that map to either the S-mode or M-mode variant depending on
    a new CONFIG_RISCV_M_MODE kconfig symbol.
