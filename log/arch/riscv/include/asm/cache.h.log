    riscv: add nommu support
    
    The kernel runs in M-mode without using page tables, and thus can't run
    bare metal without help from additional firmware.
    
    Most of the patch is just stubbing out code not needed without page
    tables, but there is an interesting detail in the signals implementation:
    
     - The normal RISC-V syscall ABI only implements rt_sigreturn as VDSO
       entry point, but the ELF VDSO is not supported for nommu Linux.
       We instead copy the code to call the syscall onto the stack.
    
    In addition to enabling the nommu code a new defconfig for a small
    kernel image that can run in nommu mode on qemu is also provided, to run
    a kernel in qemu you can use the following command line:
    
    qemu-system-riscv64 -smp 2 -m 64 -machine virt -nographic \
            -kernel arch/riscv/boot/loader \
            -drive file=rootfs.ext2,format=raw,id=hd0 \
            -device virtio-blk-device,drive=hd0

    RISC-V: Init and Halt Code
    
    This contains the various __init C functions, the initial assembly
    kernel entry point, and the code to reset the system.  When a file was
    init-related this patch contains the entire file.
