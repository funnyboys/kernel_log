    riscv: clean up the macro format in each header file
    
    There are many different formats in each header now, such as
    _ASM_XXX_H, __ASM_XXX_H, _ASM_RISCV_XXX_H, RISCV_XXX_H, etc., This patch
    tries to unify the format by using _ASM_RISCV_XXX_H, because the most
    header use it now. This patch also adds the conditional to the headers
    if they lost it.

    RISC-V: Atomic and Locking Code
    
    This contains all the code that directly interfaces with the RISC-V
    memory model.  While this code corforms to the current RISC-V ISA
    specifications (user 2.2 and priv 1.10), the memory model is somewhat
    underspecified in those documents.  There is a working group that hopes
    to produce a formal memory model by the end of the year, but my
    understanding is that the basic definitions we're relying on here won't
    change significantly.
