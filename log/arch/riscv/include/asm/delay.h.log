commit 6d60b6ee0c9777b92c47f6dc8aad1dd90612e4fa
Author: Palmer Dabbelt <palmer@dabbelt.com>
Date:   Mon Jul 10 18:05:09 2017 -0700

    RISC-V: Device, timer, IRQs, and the SBI
    
    This patch contains code that interfaces with devices that are mandated
    by the RISC-V supervisor specification and that don't have explicit
    drivers anywhere else in the tree.  This includes the staticly defined
    interrupts, the CSR-mapped timer, and virtualized SBI devices.
