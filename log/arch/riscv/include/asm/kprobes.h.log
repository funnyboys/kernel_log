    riscv: clean up the macro format in each header file
    
    There are many different formats in each header now, such as
    _ASM_XXX_H, __ASM_XXX_H, _ASM_RISCV_XXX_H, RISCV_XXX_H, etc., This patch
    tries to unify the format by using _ASM_RISCV_XXX_H, because the most
    header use it now. This patch also adds the conditional to the headers
    if they lost it.
