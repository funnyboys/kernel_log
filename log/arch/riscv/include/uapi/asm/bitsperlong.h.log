    treewide: add "WITH Linux-syscall-note" to SPDX tag of uapi headers
    
    UAPI headers licensed under GPL are supposed to have exception
    "WITH Linux-syscall-note" so that they can be included into non-GPL
    user space application code.
    
    The exception note is missing in some UAPI headers.
    
    Some of them slipped in by the treewide conversion commit b24413180f56
    ("License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with
    no license"). Just run:
    
      $ git show --oneline b24413180f56 -- arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/
    
    I believe they are not intentional, and should be fixed too.
    
    This patch was generated by the following script:
    
      git grep -l --not -e Linux-syscall-note --and -e SPDX-License-Identifier \
        -- :arch/*/include/uapi/asm/*.h :include/uapi/ :^*/Kbuild |
      while read file
      do
              sed -i -e '/[[:space:]]OR[[:space:]]/s/\(GPL-[^[:space:]]*\)/(\1 WITH Linux-syscall-note)/g' \
              -e '/[[:space:]]or[[:space:]]/s/\(GPL-[^[:space:]]*\)/(\1 WITH Linux-syscall-note)/g' \
              -e '/[[:space:]]OR[[:space:]]/!{/[[:space:]]or[[:space:]]/!s/\(GPL-[^[:space:]]*\)/\1 WITH Linux-syscall-note/g}' $file
      done
    
    After this patch is applied, there are 5 UAPI headers that do not contain
    "WITH Linux-syscall-note". They are kept untouched since this exception
    applies only to GPL variants.
    
      $ git grep --not -e Linux-syscall-note --and -e SPDX-License-Identifier \
        -- :arch/*/include/uapi/asm/*.h :include/uapi/ :^*/Kbuild
