    riscv: add prototypes for assembly language functions from head.S
    
    Add prototypes for assembly language functions defined in head.S,
    and include these prototypes into C source files that call those
    functions.
    
    This patch resolves the following warnings from sparse:
    
    arch/riscv/kernel/setup.c:39:10: warning: symbol 'hart_lottery' was not declared. Should it be static?
    arch/riscv/kernel/setup.c:42:13: warning: symbol 'parse_dtb' was not declared. Should it be static?
    arch/riscv/kernel/smpboot.c:33:6: warning: symbol '__cpu_up_stack_pointer' was not declared. Should it be static?
    arch/riscv/kernel/smpboot.c:34:6: warning: symbol '__cpu_up_task_pointer' was not declared. Should it be static?
    arch/riscv/mm/fault.c:25:17: warning: symbol 'do_page_fault' was not declared. Should it be static?
    
    This change should have no functional impact.
