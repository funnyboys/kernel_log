    sh: Kill off machvec IRQ hinting.
    
    Everything is using sparseirq these days, so we have no need to
    arbitrarily size nr_irqs ahead of time. The legacy IRQ pre-allocation
    likewise has no meaning for us, so that's killed off too. We now depend
    on nr_irqs expansion by the generic hardirq layer instead.
    
    It's also worth noting that the majority of boards had completely bogus
    values for their nr_irqs relative to their CPU and configurations, so
    this ends up correcting behaviour for quite a few platforms.

    sh: Mass ctrl_in/outX to __raw_read/writeX conversion.
    
    The old ctrl in/out routines are non-portable and unsuitable for
    cross-platform use. While drivers/sh has already been sanitized, there
    is still quite a lot of code that is not. This converts the arch/sh/ bits
    over, which permits us to flag the routines as deprecated whilst still
    building with -Werror for the architecture code, and to ensure that
    future users are not added.

    sh: heartbeat: Update boards for access size hinting.
    
    This updates the existing boards that specify the register width through
    platform data to use the resource flags instead. This eliminates platform
    data completely in most cases, and permits further improvement in the
    heartbeat driver as well as shrinking the overall private data size.

    sh: Kill off cf-enabler with extreme prejudice.
    
    Now that the rest of the boards that were using cf-enabler "generically"
    have switched to setting up their mappings on their own, only the mach-se
    boards were left using it. All of the cf-enabler using mach-se boards
    use a special initialization of the MRSHPC windows rather than going
    through the special PTE as other SH-4 platforms do. This consolidates
    the MRSHPC setup logic, hooks it up on the boards that care, and gets rid
    of any and all remaining references to cf-enabler.
    
    This has been long overdue, as cf-enabler has been the bane of
    arch/sh/kernel for the last 7 years. Good riddance.
