commit 37744feebc086908fd89760650f458ab19071750
Author: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>
Date:   Mon Apr 20 11:37:12 2020 +0200

    sh: remove sh5 support
    
    sh5 never became a product and has probably never really worked.
    
    Remove it by recursively deleting all associated Kconfig options
    and all corresponding files.
