    Now that the hwblk use cases have been ripped out, we can revert to
    asm-generic/device.h for the device/platform device arch data structures.

    sh: Runtime PM for SuperH Mobile platform bus devices
    
    This patch is V3 of the SuperH Mobile Runtime PM platform bus
    implentation matching Rafael's Runtime PM v16.
    
    The code gets invoked from the SuperH specific Runtime PM
    platform bus functions that override the weak symbols for:
     - platform_pm_runtime_suspend()
     - platform_pm_runtime_resume()
     - platform_pm_runtime_idle()
    
    This Runtime PM implementation performs two levels of power
    management. At the time of platform bus runtime suspend the
    clock to the device is stopped instantly. Later on if all
    devices within the power domain has their clocks stopped
    then the device driver ->runtime_suspend() callbacks are
    used to save hardware register state for each device.
    
    Device driver ->runtime_suspend() calls are scheduled from
    cpuidle context using platform_pm_runtime_suspend_idle().
    When all devices have been fully suspended the processor
    is allowed to enter deep sleep from cpuidle.
    
    The runtime resume operation turns on clocks and also
    restores registers if needed. It is worth noting that the
    devices start in a suspended state and the device driver
    is responsible for calling runtime resume before accessing
    the actual hardware.
    
    In this particular platform bus implementation runtime
    resume is not allowed from interrupt context. Runtime
    suspend is however allowed from interrupt context as
    long as the synchronous functions are avoided.
    
    [ updated for v17 -- PFM. ]

    sh: Runtime PM pdev hwblk
    
    These patches extend struct platform device data for a bunch of
    SuperH Mobile processors and embedded boards. The patches simply
    add hardware block ids to on-chip platform devices. Platform
    devices off chip (such as external ethernet controllers or flash
    chips) are left out which gives them a special case hardware block
    id of zero.
    
    Upcoming Runtime PM code will make use of the hardware block id
    to group devices together. The hardware block id can also be used
    to extend the SuperH Mobile clock framework implementation.
    
    This series of patches depend on the following:
    "Driver Core: Add platform device arch data V3".
    
    This patch adds a hwblk_id member to struct pdev_archdata. This member
    should be used to point out on-chip hardware block id.

    with subsequent hacking and fixups entirely my fault.
