commit 9d56dd3b083a3bec56e9da35ce07baca81030b03

    sh: Mass ctrl_in/outX to __raw_read/writeX conversion.
    
    The old ctrl in/out routines are non-portable and unsuitable for
    cross-platform use. While drivers/sh has already been sanitized, there
    is still quite a lot of code that is not. This converts the arch/sh/ bits
    over, which permits us to flag the routines as deprecated whilst still
    building with -Werror for the architecture code, and to ensure that
    future users are not added.

    sh: migrate to arch/sh/include/
    
    This follows the sparc changes a439fe51a1f8eb087c22dd24d69cebae4a3addac.
    
    Most of the moving about was done with Sam's directions at:
    
    http://marc.info/?l=linux-sh&m=121724823706062&w=2
    
    with subsequent hacking and fixups entirely my fault.
