    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    sh: get rid of superfluous __GFP_REPEAT
    
    __GFP_REPEAT has a rather weak semantic but since it has been introduced
    around 2.6.12 it has been ignored for low order allocations.
    
    PGALLOC_GFP uses __GFP_REPEAT but {pgd,pmd}_alloc allocate from
    {pgd,pmd}_cache but both caches are allocating up to PAGE_SIZE objects.
    This means that this flag has never been actually useful here because it
    has always been used only for PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY requests.

commit 5a0e3ad6af8660be21ca98a971cd00f331318c05

    include cleanup: Update gfp.h and slab.h includes to prepare for breaking implicit slab.h inclusion from percpu.h
    
    percpu.h is included by sched.h and module.h and thus ends up being
    included when building most .c files.  percpu.h includes slab.h which
    in turn includes gfp.h making everything defined by the two files
    universally available and complicating inclusion dependencies.
    
    percpu.h -> slab.h dependency is about to be removed.  Prepare for
    this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those
    headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion
    needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is
    used as the basis of conversion.
    
      http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py
    
    The script does the followings.
    
    * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that
      only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,
      gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.
    
    * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include
      blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms
      to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains
      core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -
      alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there
      doesn't seem to be any matching order.
    
    * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly
      because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out
      an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the
      file.
    
    The conversion was done in the following steps.
    
    1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly
       over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h
       and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400
       files.
    
    2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,
       some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or
       embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added
       inclusions to around 150 files.
    
    3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits
       from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.
    
    4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.
       e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab
       APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.
    
    5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically
       editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h
       files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h
       inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually
       wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each
       slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as
       necessary.
    
    6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.
    
    7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures
       were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my
       distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few
       more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things
       build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).
    
       * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.
       * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig
       * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig
       * ia64 SMP allmodconfig
       * s390 SMP allmodconfig
       * alpha SMP allmodconfig
       * um on x86_64 SMP allmodconfig
    
    8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as
       a separate patch and serve as bisection point.
    
    Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step
    6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch.
    If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch
    headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of
    the specific arch.

    sh: default to extended TLB support.
    
    All SH-X2 and SH-X3 parts support an extended TLB mode, which has been
    left as experimental since support was originally merged. Now that it's
    had some time to stabilize and get some exposure to various platforms,
    we can drop it as an option and default enable it across the board.
    
    This is also good future proofing for newer parts that will drop support
    for the legacy TLB mode completely.
    
    This will also force 3-level page tables for all newer parts, which is
    necessary both for the varying page sizes and larger memories.

    sh: Move page table allocation out of line
    
    We also switched away from quicklists and instead moved to slab
    caches. After benchmarking both implementations the difference is
    negligible. The slab caches suit us better though because the size of a
    pgd table is just 4 entries when we're using a 3-level page table layout
    and quicklists always deal with pages.
