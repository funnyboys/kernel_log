    s390: move ipl block and cmd line handling to early boot phase
    
    To distinguish zfcpdump case and to be able to parse some of the kernel
    command line arguments early (e.g. mem=) ipl block retrieval and command
    line construction code is moved to the early boot phase.
    
    "memory_end" is set up correctly respecting "mem=" and hsa_size in case
    of the zfcpdump.
    
    arch/s390/boot/string.c is introduced to provide string handling and
    command line parsing functions to early boot phase code for the compressed
    kernel image case.
