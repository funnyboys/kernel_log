    s390/decompressor: avoid reusing uncompressed image objects
    
    Re-compile ebcdic.c and sclp_early_core.c for the decompressor,
    using proper decompressor CFLAGS. This also allows to potentially use
    instrumentation for those files when built for the main kernel image.
    
    With kbuild there is no easy way to re-compile a source file from
    another directory. Bypass ugly rules and Makefile meta-programming
    with relative path includes of original files.
