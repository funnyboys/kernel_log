    s390: add a few more SPDX identifiers
    
    Add the correct SPDX license to a few more files under arch/s390 and
    drivers/s390 which have been missed to far.
    The SPDX identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which can be used
    instead of the full boiler plate text.

    s390/comments: unify copyright messages and remove file names
    
    Remove the file name from the comment at top of many files. In most
    cases the file name was wrong anyway, so it's rather pointless.
    
    Also unify the IBM copyright statement. We did have a lot of sightly
    different statements and wanted to change them one after another
    whenever a file gets touched. However that never happened. Instead
    people start to take the old/"wrong" statements to use as a template
    for new files.
    So unify all of them in one go.
