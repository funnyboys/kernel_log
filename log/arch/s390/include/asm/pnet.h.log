    s390/net: move pnet constants
    
    There is no need to define these PNETID related constants in
    the pnet.h file, since they are just used locally within pnet.c.
    Just code cleanup, no functional change.

    s390/net: add pnetid support
    
    s390 hardware supports the definition of a so-call Physical NETwork
    IDentifier (short PNETID) per network device port. These PNETIDS
    can be used to identify network devices that are attached to the same
    physical network (broadcast domain).
    
    This patch provides the interface to extract the PNETID of a port of
    a device attached to the ccw-bus or pci-bus.
    
    Parts of this patch are based on an initial implementation by
    Thomas Richter.
