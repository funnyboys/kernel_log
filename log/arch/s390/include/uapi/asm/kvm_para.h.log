    s390: include: Remove redundant license text
    
    Now that the SPDX tag is in all arch/s390/include/ files, that
    identifies the license in a specific and legally-defined manner.  So the
    extra GPL text wording can be removed as it is no longer needed at all.
    
    This is done on a quest to remove the 700+ different ways that files in
    the kernel describe the GPL license text.  And there's unneeded stuff
    like the address (sometimes incorrect) for the FSF which is never
    needed.
    
    No copyright headers or other non-license-description text was removed.

commit e2be04c7f9958dde770eeb8b30e829ca969b37bb
Author: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with a license
    
    Many user space API headers have licensing information, which is either
    incomplete, badly formatted or just a shorthand for referring to the
    license under which the file is supposed to be.  This makes it hard for
    compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    Update these files with an SPDX license identifier.  The identifier was
    chosen based on the license information in the file.
    
    GPL/LGPL licensed headers get the matching GPL/LGPL SPDX license
    identifier with the added 'WITH Linux-syscall-note' exception, which is
    the officially assigned exception identifier for the kernel syscall
    exception:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    This exception makes it possible to include GPL headers into non GPL
    code, without confusing license compliance tools.
    
    Headers which have either explicit dual licensing or are just licensed
    under a non GPL license are updated with the corresponding SPDX
    identifier and the GPLv2 with syscall exception identifier.  The format
    is:
            ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR SPDX-ID-OF-OTHER-LICENSE)
    
    SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding shorthand, which can be
    used instead of the full boiler plate text.  The update does not remove
    existing license information as this has to be done on a case by case
    basis and the copyright holders might have to be consulted. This will
    happen in a separate step.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.

    s390,uapi: do not use uapi/asm-generic/kvm_para.h
    
    It turns out that S390 shouldn't use uapi/asm-generic/kvm_para.h since it
    defines the functions in its non-UAPI kvm_para.h file.
    
    #including <asm-generic/kvm_para.h> will first pick up
    include/asm-generic/kvm_para.h, which defines conflicting functions.
    
    Instead, partially revert commit 0420c87e648a3b623ad925038a0bcff2ef5a4bc9,
    ungenericising this file and just inserting a comment to prevent the patch
    program from deleting it.

commit 0420c87e648a3b623ad925038a0bcff2ef5a4bc9

    UAPI: Put a comment into uapi/asm-generic/kvm_para.h and use it from arches
    
    Make uapi/asm-generic/kvm_para.h non-empty by addition of a comment to stop
    the patch program from deleting it when it creates it.
    
    Then delete empty arch-specific uapi/asm/kvm_para.h files and tell the Kbuild
    files to use the generic instead.
    
    Should this perhaps instead be a #warning or #error that the facility is
    unsupported on this arch?
