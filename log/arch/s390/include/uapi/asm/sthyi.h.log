    s390: add a few more SPDX identifiers
    
    Add the correct SPDX license to a few more files under arch/s390 and
    drivers/s390 which have been missed to far.
    The SPDX identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which can be used
    instead of the full boiler plate text.

    s390/sthyi: add s390_sthyi system call
    
    Add a syscall of s390_sthyi to implement STHYI instruction in LPAR
    which reuses the implementation for KVM by Janosch Frank -
    commit 95ca2cb57985 ("KVM: s390: Add sthyi emulation").
    
    STHYI(Store Hypervisor Information) is an emulated z/VM instruction that
    provides a guest with basic information about the layers it is running
    on. This includes information about the cpu configuration of both the
    machine and the lpar, as well as their names, machine model and
    machine type. This information enables an application to determine the
    maximum capacity of CPs and IFLs available to software.
    
    For the arguments of s390_sthyi, code shall be 0 and flags is reserved for
    future use, info is the output argument to store the required hypervisor
    info.
