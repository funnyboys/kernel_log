    sparc, sparc64: use arch/sparc/include
    
    The majority of this patch was created by the following script:
    
    ***
    ASM=arch/sparc/include/asm
    mkdir -p $ASM
    git mv include/asm-sparc64/ftrace.h $ASM
    git rm include/asm-sparc64/*
    git mv include/asm-sparc/* $ASM
    sed -ie 's/asm-sparc64/asm/g' $ASM/*
    sed -ie 's/asm-sparc/asm/g' $ASM/*
    ***
    
    The rest was an update of the top-level Makefile to use sparc
    for header files when sparc64 is being build.
    And a small fixlet to pick up the correct unistd.h from
    sparc64 code.
