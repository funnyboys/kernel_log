    sparc: Fix VDSO build with older binutils.
    
    Older versions of bintutils do not allow symbol math across different
    segments on sparc:
    
    ====================
    Assembler messages:
    99: Error: operation combines symbols in different segments
    ====================
    
    This is controlled by whether or not DIFF_EXPR_OK is defined in
    gas/config/tc-*.h and for sparc this was not the case until mid-2017.
    
    So we have to patch between %stick and %tick another way.
    
    Do what powerpc does and emit two versions of the relevant functions,
    one using %tick and one using %stick, and patch the symbols in the
    dynamic symbol table.

    sparc: Improve VDSO instruction patching.
    
    The current VDSO patch mechanism has several problems:
    
    1) It assumes how gcc will emit a function, with a register
       window, an initial save instruction and then immediately
       the %tick read when compiling vread_tick().
    
       There is no such guarantees, code generation could change
       at any time, gcc could put a nop between the save and
       the %tick read, etc.
    
       So this is extremely fragile and would fail some day.
    
    2) It disallows us to properly inline vread_tick() into the callers
       and thus get the best possible code sequences.
    
    So fix this to patch properly, with location based annotations.
    
    We have to be careful because we cannot do it the way we do
    patches elsewhere in the kernel.  Those use a sequence like:
    
            1:
            insn
            .section        .whatever_patch, "ax"
            .word           1b
            replacement_insn
            .previous
    
    This is a dynamic shared object, so that .word cannot be resolved at
    build time, and thus cannot be used to execute the patches when the
    kernel initializes the images.
    
    Even trying to use label difference equations doesn't work in the
    above kind of scheme:
    
            1:
            insn
            .section        .whatever_patch, "ax"
            .word           . - 1b
            replacement_insn
            .previous
    
    The assembler complains that it cannot resolve that computation.
    The issue is that this is contained in an executable section.
    
    Borrow the sequence used by x86 alternatives, which is:
    
            1:
            insn
            .pushsection    .whatever_patch, "a"
            .word           . - 1b, . - 1f
            .popsection
            .pushsection    .whatever_patch_replacements, "ax"
            1:
            replacement_insn
            .previous
    
    This works, allows us to inline vread_tick() as much as we like, and
    can be used for arbitrary kinds of VDSO patching in the future.
    
    Also, reverse the condition for patching.  Most systems are %stick
    based, so if we only patch on %tick systems the patching code will
    get little or no testing.

    vDSO for sparc
    
    Following patch is based on work done by Nick Alcock on 64-bit vDSO for sparc
    in Oracle linux. I have extended it to include support for 32-bit vDSO for sparc
    on 64-bit kernel.
    
    vDSO for sparc is based on the X86 implementation. This patch
    provides vDSO support for both 64-bit and 32-bit programs on 64-bit kernel.
    vDSO will be disabled on 32-bit linux kernel on sparc.
    
    *) vclock_gettime.c contains all the vdso functions. Since data page is mapped
       before the vdso code page, the pointer to data page is got by subracting offset
       from an address in the vdso code page. The return address stored in
       %i7 is used for this purpose.
    *) During compilation, both 32-bit and 64-bit vdso images are compiled and are
       converted into raw bytes by vdso2c program to be ready for mapping into the
       process. 32-bit images are compiled only if CONFIG_COMPAT is enabled. vdso2c
       generates two files vdso-image-64.c and vdso-image-32.c which contains the
       respective vDSO image in C structure.
    *) During vdso initialization, required number of vdso pages are allocated and
       raw bytes are copied into the pages.
    *) During every exec, these pages are mapped into the process through
       arch_setup_additional_pages and the location of mapping is passed on to the
       process through aux vector AT_SYSINFO_EHDR which is used by glibc.
    *) A new update_vsyscall routine for sparc is added to keep the data page in
       vdso updated.
    *) As vDSO cannot contain dynamically relocatable references, a new version of
       cpu_relax is added for the use of vDSO.
    
    This change also requires a putback to glibc to use vDSO. For testing,
    programs planning to try vDSO can be compiled against the generated
    vdso(64/32).so in the source.
    
    Testing:
    
    ========
    [root@localhost ~]# cat vdso_test.c

            struct timespec tv_start, tv_end;
            struct timeval tv_tmp;

            int count = 1 * 1000 * 10000;
            long long diff;
    
            clock_gettime(0, &tv_start);
            for (i = 0; i < count; i++)
                  gettimeofday(&tv_tmp, NULL);
            clock_gettime(0, &tv_end);
            diff = (long long)(tv_end.tv_sec -
                    tv_start.tv_sec)*(1*1000*1000*1000);
            diff += (tv_end.tv_nsec - tv_start.tv_nsec);
            printf("Start sec: %d\n", tv_start.tv_sec);
            printf("End sec  : %d\n", tv_end.tv_sec);
            printf("%d cycles in %lld ns = %f ns/cycle\n", count, diff,
                    (double)diff / (double)count);

    V1 to V2 Changes:
    =================
            Added hot patching code to switch the read stick instruction to read
    tick instruction based on the hardware.
    
    V2 to V3 Changes:
    =================
            Merged latest changes from sparc-next and moved the initialization
    of clocksource_tick.archdata.vclock_mode to time_init_early. Disabled
    queued spinlock and rwlock configuration when simulating 32-bit config
    to compile 32-bit VDSO.
    
    V3 to V4 Changes:
    =================
            Hardcoded the page size as 8192 in linker script for both 64-bit and
    32-bit binaries. Removed unused variables in vdso2c.h. Added -mv8plus flag to
    Makefile to prevent the generation of relocation entries for __lshrdi3 in 32-bit
    vdso binary.
