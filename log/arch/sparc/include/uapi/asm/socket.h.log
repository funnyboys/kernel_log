    bpf: net: Add SO_DETACH_REUSEPORT_BPF
    
    There is SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_[CE]BPF but there is no DETACH.
    This patch adds SO_DETACH_REUSEPORT_BPF sockopt.  The same
    sockopt can be used to undo both SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_[CE]BPF.
    
    reseport_detach_prog() is added and it is mostly a mirror
    of the existing reuseport_attach_prog().  The differences are,
    it does not call reuseport_alloc() and returns -ENOENT when
    there is no old prog.

    y2038: fix socket.h header inclusion
    
    Referencing the __kernel_long_t type caused some user space applications
    to stop compiling when they had not already included linux/posix_types.h,
    e.g.
    
    s/multicast.c -o ext/sockets/multicast.lo
    In file included from /builddir/build/BUILD/php-7.3.3/main/php.h:468,
                     from /builddir/build/BUILD/php-7.3.3/ext/sockets/sockets.c:27:
    /builddir/build/BUILD/php-7.3.3/ext/sockets/sockets.c: In function 'zm_startup_sockets':
    /builddir/build/BUILD/php-7.3.3/ext/sockets/sockets.c:776:40: error: '__kernel_long_t' undeclared (first use in this function)
      776 |  REGISTER_LONG_CONSTANT("SO_SNDTIMEO", SO_SNDTIMEO, CONST_CS | CONST_PERSISTENT);
    
    It is safe to include that header here, since it only contains kernel
    internal types that do not conflict with other user space types.
    
    It's still possible that some related build failures remain, but those
    are likely to be for code that is not already y2038 safe.

    socket: Rename SO_RCVTIMEO/ SO_SNDTIMEO with _OLD suffixes
    
    SO_RCVTIMEO and SO_SNDTIMEO socket options use struct timeval
    as the time format. struct timeval is not y2038 safe.
    The subsequent patches in the series add support for new socket
    timeout options with _NEW suffix that will use y2038 safe
    data structures. Although the existing struct timeval layout
    is sufficiently wide to represent timeouts, because of the way
    libc will interpret time_t based on user defined flag, these
    new flags provide a way of having a structure that is the same
    for all architectures consistently.
    Rename the existing options with _OLD suffix forms so that the
    right option is enabled for userspace applications according
    to the architecture and time_t definition of libc.

    sockopt: Rename SO_TIMESTAMP* to SO_TIMESTAMP*_OLD
    
    SO_TIMESTAMP, SO_TIMESTAMPNS and SO_TIMESTAMPING options, the
    way they are currently defined, are not y2038 safe.
    Subsequent patches in the series add new y2038 safe versions
    of these options which provide 64 bit timestamps on all
    architectures uniformly.
    Hence, rename existing options with OLD tag suffixes.
    
    Also note that kernel will not use the untagged SO_TIMESTAMP*
    and SCM_TIMESTAMP* options internally anymore.

commit f5dd3d0c9638a9d9a02b5964c4ad636f06cf7e2c
Author: David Herrmann <dh.herrmann@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Jan 15 14:42:14 2019 +0100

    net: introduce SO_BINDTOIFINDEX sockopt
    
    This introduces a new generic SOL_SOCKET-level socket option called
    SO_BINDTOIFINDEX. It behaves similar to SO_BINDTODEVICE, but takes a
    network interface index as argument, rather than the network interface
    name.
    
    User-space often refers to network-interfaces via their index, but has
    to temporarily resolve it to a name for a call into SO_BINDTODEVICE.
    This might pose problems when the network-device is renamed
    asynchronously by other parts of the system. When this happens, the
    SO_BINDTODEVICE might either fail, or worse, it might bind to the wrong
    device.
    
    In most cases user-space only ever operates on devices which they
    either manage themselves, or otherwise have a guarantee that the device
    name will not change (e.g., devices that are UP cannot be renamed).
    However, particularly in libraries this guarantee is non-obvious and it
    would be nice if that race-condition would simply not exist. It would
    make it easier for those libraries to operate even in situations where
    the device-name might change under the hood.
    
    A real use-case that we recently hit is trying to start the network
    stack early in the initrd but make it survive into the real system.
    Existing distributions rename network-interfaces during the transition
    from initrd into the real system. This, obviously, cannot affect
    devices that are up and running (unless you also consider moving them
    between network-namespaces). However, the network manager now has to
    make sure its management engine for dormant devices will not run in
    parallel to these renames. Particularly, when you offload operations
    like DHCP into separate processes, these might setup their sockets
    early, and thus have to resolve the device-name possibly running into
    this race-condition.
    
    By avoiding a call to resolve the device-name, we no longer depend on
    the name and can run network setup of dormant devices in parallel to
    the transition off the initrd. The SO_BINDTOIFINDEX ioctl plugs this
    race.

    net: Add a new socket option for a future transmit time.
    
    This patch introduces SO_TXTIME. User space enables this option in
    order to pass a desired future transmit time in a CMSG when calling
    sendmsg(2). The argument to this socket option is a 8-bytes long struct
    provided by the uapi header net_tstamp.h defined as:
    
    struct sock_txtime {
            clockid_t       clockid;
            u32             flags;
    };
    
    Note that new fields were added to struct sock by filling a 2-bytes
    hole found in the struct. For that reason, neither the struct size or
    number of cachelines were altered.

    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with no license
    
    Many user space API headers are missing licensing information, which
    makes it hard for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default are files without license information under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPLV2.  Marking them GPLV2 would exclude
    them from being included in non GPLV2 code, which is obviously not
    intended. The user space API headers fall under the syscall exception
    which is in the kernels COPYING file:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    otherwise syscall usage would not be possible.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with an SPDX
    license identifier.  The chosen identifier is 'GPL-2.0 WITH
    Linux-syscall-note' which is the officially assigned identifier for the
    Linux syscall exception.  SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.

    sock: add SOCK_ZEROCOPY sockopt
    
    The send call ignores unknown flags. Legacy applications may already
    unwittingly pass MSG_ZEROCOPY. Continue to ignore this flag unless a
    socket opts in to zerocopy.
    
    Introduce socket option SO_ZEROCOPY to enable MSG_ZEROCOPY processing.
    Processes can also query this socket option to detect kernel support
    for the feature. Older kernels will return ENOPROTOOPT.

commit 28b5ba2aa0f55d80adb2624564ed2b170c19519e
Author: David Herrmann <dh.herrmann@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Jun 21 10:47:15 2017 +0200

    net: introduce SO_PEERGROUPS getsockopt
    
    This adds the new getsockopt(2) option SO_PEERGROUPS on SOL_SOCKET to
    retrieve the auxiliary groups of the remote peer. It is designed to
    naturally extend SO_PEERCRED. That is, the underlying data is from the
    same credentials. Regarding its syntax, it is based on SO_PEERSEC. That
    is, if the provided buffer is too small, ERANGE is returned and @optlen
    is updated. Otherwise, the information is copied, @optlen is set to the
    actual size, and 0 is returned.
    
    While SO_PEERCRED (and thus `struct ucred') already returns the primary
    group, it lacks the auxiliary group vector. However, nearly all access
    controls (including kernel side VFS and SYSVIPC, but also user-space
    polkit, DBus, ...) consider the entire set of groups, rather than just
    the primary group. But this is currently not possible with pure
    SO_PEERCRED. Instead, user-space has to work around this and query the
    system database for the auxiliary groups of a UID retrieved via
    SO_PEERCRED.
    
    Unfortunately, there is no race-free way to query the auxiliary groups
    of the PID/UID retrieved via SO_PEERCRED. Hence, the current user-space
    solution is to use getgrouplist(3p), which itself falls back to NSS and
    whatever is configured in nsswitch.conf(3). This effectively checks
    which groups we *would* assign to the user if it logged in *now*. On
    normal systems it is as easy as reading /etc/group, but with NSS it can
    resort to quering network databases (eg., LDAP), using IPC or network
    communication.
    
    Long story short: Whenever we want to use auxiliary groups for access
    checks on IPC, we need further IPC to talk to the user/group databases,
    rather than just relying on SO_PEERCRED and the incoming socket. This
    is unfortunate, and might even result in dead-locks if the database
    query uses the same IPC as the original request.
    
    So far, those recursions / dead-locks have been avoided by using
    primitive IPC for all crucial NSS modules. However, we want to avoid
    re-inventing the wheel for each NSS module that might be involved in
    user/group queries. Hence, we would preferably make DBus (and other IPC
    that supports access-management based on groups) work without resorting
    to the user/group database. This new SO_PEERGROUPS ioctl would allow us
    to make dbus-daemon work without ever calling into NSS.

    tcp: SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_STATS option for SO_TIMESTAMPING
    
    This patch exports the sender chronograph stats via the socket
    SO_TIMESTAMPING channel. Currently we can instrument how long a
    particular application unit of data was queued in TCP by tracking
    SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_SOFTWARE and SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_SCHED. Having
    these sender chronograph stats exported simultaneously along with
    these timestamps allow further breaking down the various sender
    limitation.  For example, a video server can tell if a particular
    chunk of video on a connection takes a long time to deliver because
    TCP was experiencing small receive window. It is not possible to
    tell before this patch without packet traces.
    
    To prepare these stats, the user needs to set
    SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_STATS and SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_TSONLY flags
    while requesting other SOF_TIMESTAMPING TX timestamps. When the
    timestamps are available in the error queue, the stats are returned
    in a separate control message of type SCM_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_STATS,
    in a list of TLVs (struct nlattr) of types: TCP_NLA_BUSY_TIME,
    TCP_NLA_RWND_LIMITED, TCP_NLA_SNDBUF_LIMITED. Unit is microsecond.

    net: Facility to report route quality of connected sockets
    
    This patch add the SO_CNX_ADVICE socket option (setsockopt only). The
    purpose is to allow an application to give feedback to the kernel about
    the quality of the network path for a connected socket. The value
    argument indicates the type of quality report. For this initial patch
    the only supported advice is a value of 1 which indicates "bad path,
    please reroute"-- the action taken by the kernel is to call
    dst_negative_advice which will attempt to choose a different ECMP route,
    reset the TX hash for flow label and UDP source port in encapsulation,
    etc.
    
    This facility should be useful for connected UDP sockets where only the
    application can provide any feedback about path quality. It could also
    be useful for TCP applications that have additional knowledge about the
    path outside of the normal TCP control loop.

    introduce new setsockopt() command:
    
    setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_BPF, &prog_fd, sizeof(prog_fd))
    
    where prog_fd was received from syscall bpf(BPF_PROG_LOAD, attr, ...)
    and attr->prog_type == BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET_FILTER
    
    setsockopt() calls bpf_prog_get() which increments refcnt of the program,
    so it doesn't get unloaded while socket is using the program.
    
    The same eBPF program can be attached to multiple sockets.
    
    User task exit automatically closes socket which calls sk_filter_uncharge()
    which decrements refcnt of eBPF program

    net: introduce SO_INCOMING_CPU
    
    Alternative to RPS/RFS is to use hardware support for multiple
    queues.
    
    Then split a set of million of sockets into worker threads, each
    one using epoll() to manage events on its own socket pool.
    
    Ideally, we want one thread per RX/TX queue/cpu, but we have no way to
    know after accept() or connect() on which queue/cpu a socket is managed.
    
    We normally use one cpu per RX queue (IRQ smp_affinity being properly
    set), so remembering on socket structure which cpu delivered last packet
    is enough to solve the problem.
    
    After accept(), connect(), or even file descriptor passing around
    processes, applications can use :
    
     int cpu;
     socklen_t len = sizeof(cpu);
    
     getsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_INCOMING_CPU, &cpu, &len);
    
    And use this information to put the socket into the right silo
    for optimal performance, as all networking stack should run
    on the appropriate cpu, without need to send IPI (RPS/RFS).

commit ea02f9411d9faa3553ed09ce0ec9f00ceae9885e
Author: Michal Sekletar <msekleta@redhat.com>
Date:   Fri Jan 17 17:09:45 2014 +0100

    net: introduce SO_BPF_EXTENSIONS
    
    For user space packet capturing libraries such as libpcap, there's
    currently only one way to check which BPF extensions are supported
    by the kernel, that is, commit aa1113d9f85d ("net: filter: return
    -EINVAL if BPF_S_ANC* operation is not supported"). For querying all
    extensions at once this might be rather inconvenient.
    
    Therefore, this patch introduces a new option which can be used as
    an argument for getsockopt(), and allows one to obtain information
    about which BPF extensions are supported by the current kernel.
    
    As David Miller suggests, we do not need to define any bits right
    now and status quo can just return 0 in order to state that this
    versions supports SKF_AD_PROTOCOL up to SKF_AD_PAY_OFFSET. Later
    additions to BPF extensions need to add their bits to the
    bpf_tell_extensions() function, as documented in the comment.

commit 62748f32d501f5d3712a7c372bbb92abc7c62bc7
Author: Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 24 08:20:52 2013 -0700

    net: introduce SO_MAX_PACING_RATE
    
    As mentioned in commit afe4fd062416b ("pkt_sched: fq: Fair Queue packet
    scheduler"), this patch adds a new socket option.
    
    SO_MAX_PACING_RATE offers the application the ability to cap the
    rate computed by transport layer. Value is in bytes per second.
    
    u32 val = 1000000;
    setsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_MAX_PACING_RATE, &val, sizeof(val));
    
    To be effectively paced, a flow must use FQ packet scheduler.
    
    Note that a packet scheduler takes into account the headers for its
    computations. The effective payload rate depends on MSS and retransmits
    if any.
    
    I chose to make this pacing rate a SOL_SOCKET option instead of a
    TCP one because this can be used by other protocols.

commit 7d4c04fc170087119727119074e72445f2bb192b

    net: add option to enable error queue packets waking select
    
    Currently, when a socket receives something on the error queue it only wakes up
    the socket on select if it is in the "read" list, that is the socket has
    something to read. It is useful also to wake the socket if it is in the error
    list, which would enable software to wait on error queue packets without waking
    up for regular data on the socket. The main use case is for receiving
    timestamped transmit packets which return the timestamp to the socket via the
    error queue. This enables an application to select on the socket for the error
    queue only instead of for the regular traffic.
    
    -v2-
    * Added the SO_SELECT_ERR_QUEUE socket option to every architechture specific file
    * Modified every socket poll function that checks error queue

    sk-filter: Add ability to lock a socket filter program
    
    While a privileged program can open a raw socket, attach some
    restrictive filter and drop its privileges (or send the socket to an
    unprivileged program through some Unix socket), the filter can still
    be removed or modified by the unprivileged program. This commit adds a
    socket option to lock the filter (SO_LOCK_FILTER) preventing any
    modification of a socket filter program.
    
    This is similar to OpenBSD BIOCLOCK ioctl on bpf sockets, except even
    root is not allowed change/drop the filter.
    
    The state of the lock can be read with getsockopt(). No error is
    triggered if the state is not changed. -EPERM is returned when a user
    tries to remove the lock or to change/remove the filter while the lock
    is active. The check is done directly in sk_attach_filter() and
    sk_detach_filter() and does not affect only setsockopt() syscall.

commit a8fc92778080c845eaadc369a0ecf5699a03bef0
Author: Pavel Emelyanov <xemul@parallels.com>
Date:   Thu Nov 1 02:01:48 2012 +0000

    sk-filter: Add ability to get socket filter program (v2)
    
    The SO_ATTACH_FILTER option is set only. I propose to add the get
    ability by using SO_ATTACH_FILTER in getsockopt. To be less
    irritating to eyes the SO_GET_FILTER alias to it is declared. This
    ability is required by checkpoint-restore project to be able to
    save full state of a socket.
    
    There are two issues with getting filter back.
    
    First, kernel modifies the sock_filter->code on filter load, thus in
    order to return the filter element back to user we have to decode it
    into user-visible constants. Fortunately the modification in question
    is interconvertible.
    
    Second, the BPF_S_ALU_DIV_K code modifies the command argument k to
    speed up the run-time division by doing kernel_k = reciprocal(user_k).
    Bad news is that different user_k may result in same kernel_k, so we
    can't get the original user_k back. Good news is that we don't have
    to do it. What we need to is calculate a user2_k so, that
    
      reciprocal(user2_k) == reciprocal(user_k) == kernel_k
    
    i.e. if it's re-loaded back the compiled again value will be exactly
    the same as it was. That said, the user2_k can be calculated like this
    
      user2_k = reciprocal(kernel_k)
    
    with an exception, that if kernel_k == 0, then user2_k == 1.
    
    The optlen argument is treated like this -- when zero, kernel returns
    the amount of sock_fprog elements in filter, otherwise it should be
    large enough for the sock_fprog array.
    
    changes since v1:
    * Declared SO_GET_FILTER in all arch headers
    * Added decode of vlan-tag codes
