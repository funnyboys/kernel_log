    arch: msgbuf.h: make uapi asm/msgbuf.h self-contained
    
    Userspace cannot compile <asm/msgbuf.h> due to some missing type
    definitions.  For example, building it for x86 fails as follows:
    
        CC      usr/include/asm/msgbuf.h.s
      In file included from usr/include/asm/msgbuf.h:6:0,
                       from <command-line>:32:

        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      usr/include/asm-generic/msgbuf.h:41:2: error: unknown type name `__kernel_pid_t'
        __kernel_pid_t msg_lspid; /* pid of last msgsnd */
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        __kernel_pid_t msg_lrpid; /* last receive pid */
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    It is just a matter of missing include directive.
    
    Include <asm/ipcbuf.h> to make it self-contained, and add it to
    the compile-test coverage.

    y2038: ipc: remove __kernel_time_t reference from headers
    
    There are two structures based on time_t that conflict between libc and
    kernel: timeval and timespec. Both are now renamed to __kernel_old_timeval
    and __kernel_old_timespec.
    
    For time_t, the old typedef is still __kernel_time_t. There is nothing
    wrong with that name, but it would be nice to not use that going forward
    as this type is used almost only in deprecated interfaces because of
    the y2038 overflow.
    
    In the IPC headers (msgbuf.h, sembuf.h, shmbuf.h), __kernel_time_t is only
    used for the 64-bit variants, which are not deprecated.
    
    Change these to a plain 'long', which is the same type as __kernel_time_t
    on all 64-bit architectures anyway, to reduce the number of users of the
    old type.

    y2038: sparc: Extend sysvipc data structures
    
    sparc, uses a nonstandard variation of the generic sysvipc
    data structures, intended to have the padding moved around
    so it can deal with big-endian 32-bit user space that has
    64-bit time_t.
    
    Unlike most architectures, sparc actually succeeded in
    defining this right for big-endian CPUs, but as everyone else
    got it wrong, we just use the same hack everywhere.
    
    This takes just take the same approach here that we have for
    the asm-generic headers and adds separate 32-bit fields for the
    upper halves of the timestamps, to let libc deal with the mess
    in user space.

    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with no license
    
    Many user space API headers are missing licensing information, which
    makes it hard for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default are files without license information under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPLV2.  Marking them GPLV2 would exclude
    them from being included in non GPLV2 code, which is obviously not
    intended. The user space API headers fall under the syscall exception
    which is in the kernels COPYING file:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    otherwise syscall usage would not be possible.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with an SPDX
    license identifier.  The chosen identifier is 'GPL-2.0 WITH
    Linux-syscall-note' which is the officially assigned identifier for the
    Linux syscall exception.  SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.
