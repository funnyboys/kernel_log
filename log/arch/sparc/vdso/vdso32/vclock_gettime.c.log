    sparc,x86: vdso: remove meaningless undefining CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING
    
    The code, #undef CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING, is not working as expected
    because <linux/compiler_types.h> is parsed before vclock_gettime.c since
    28128c61e08e ("kconfig.h: Include compiler types to avoid missed struct
    attributes").
    
    Since then, <linux/compiler_types.h> is included really early by using the
    '-include' option.  So, you cannot negate the decision of
    <linux/compiler_types.h> in this way.
    
    You can confirm it by checking the pre-processed code, like this:
    
      $ make arch/x86/entry/vdso/vdso32/vclock_gettime.i
    
    There is no difference with/without CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE.
    
    It is about two years since 28128c61e08e.  Nobody has reported a problem
    (or, nobody has even noticed the fact that this code is not working).
    
    It is ugly and unreliable to attempt to undefine a CONFIG option from C
    files, and anyway the inlining heuristic is up to the compiler.
    
    Just remove the broken code.

    vDSO for sparc
    
    Following patch is based on work done by Nick Alcock on 64-bit vDSO for sparc
    in Oracle linux. I have extended it to include support for 32-bit vDSO for sparc
    on 64-bit kernel.
    
    vDSO for sparc is based on the X86 implementation. This patch
    provides vDSO support for both 64-bit and 32-bit programs on 64-bit kernel.
    vDSO will be disabled on 32-bit linux kernel on sparc.
    
    *) vclock_gettime.c contains all the vdso functions. Since data page is mapped
       before the vdso code page, the pointer to data page is got by subracting offset
       from an address in the vdso code page. The return address stored in
       %i7 is used for this purpose.
    *) During compilation, both 32-bit and 64-bit vdso images are compiled and are
       converted into raw bytes by vdso2c program to be ready for mapping into the
       process. 32-bit images are compiled only if CONFIG_COMPAT is enabled. vdso2c
       generates two files vdso-image-64.c and vdso-image-32.c which contains the
       respective vDSO image in C structure.
    *) During vdso initialization, required number of vdso pages are allocated and
       raw bytes are copied into the pages.
    *) During every exec, these pages are mapped into the process through
       arch_setup_additional_pages and the location of mapping is passed on to the
       process through aux vector AT_SYSINFO_EHDR which is used by glibc.
    *) A new update_vsyscall routine for sparc is added to keep the data page in
       vdso updated.
    *) As vDSO cannot contain dynamically relocatable references, a new version of
       cpu_relax is added for the use of vDSO.
    
    This change also requires a putback to glibc to use vDSO. For testing,
    programs planning to try vDSO can be compiled against the generated
    vdso(64/32).so in the source.
    
    Testing:
    
    ========
    [root@localhost ~]# cat vdso_test.c
    int main() {
            struct timespec tv_start, tv_end;
            struct timeval tv_tmp;
            int i;
            int count = 1 * 1000 * 10000;
            long long diff;
    
            clock_gettime(0, &tv_start);
            for (i = 0; i < count; i++)
                  gettimeofday(&tv_tmp, NULL);
            clock_gettime(0, &tv_end);
            diff = (long long)(tv_end.tv_sec -
                    tv_start.tv_sec)*(1*1000*1000*1000);
            diff += (tv_end.tv_nsec - tv_start.tv_nsec);
            printf("Start sec: %d\n", tv_start.tv_sec);
            printf("End sec  : %d\n", tv_end.tv_sec);
            printf("%d cycles in %lld ns = %f ns/cycle\n", count, diff,
                    (double)diff / (double)count);
            return 0;
    }

    V1 to V2 Changes:
    =================
            Added hot patching code to switch the read stick instruction to read
    tick instruction based on the hardware.
    
    V2 to V3 Changes:
    =================
            Merged latest changes from sparc-next and moved the initialization
    of clocksource_tick.archdata.vclock_mode to time_init_early. Disabled
    queued spinlock and rwlock configuration when simulating 32-bit config
    to compile 32-bit VDSO.
    
    V3 to V4 Changes:
    =================
            Hardcoded the page size as 8192 in linker script for both 64-bit and
    32-bit binaries. Removed unused variables in vdso2c.h. Added -mv8plus flag to
    Makefile to prevent the generation of relocation entries for __lshrdi3 in 32-bit
    vdso binary.
