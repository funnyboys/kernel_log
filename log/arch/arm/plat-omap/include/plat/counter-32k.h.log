    ARM: OMAP: Remove plat-omap/common.h
    
    Most of the prototypes in plat-omap/common.h are not
    common to omap1 and omap2+, they are local to omap2+
    and should not be in plat-omap/common.h.
    
    The only shared function prototype in this file is
    omap_init_clocksource_32k(), let's put that into
    counter-32k.h.
    
    Note that the new plat/counter-32k.h must not be
    included from drivers, that will break omap2+ build
    for CONFIG_MULTIPLATFORM.
