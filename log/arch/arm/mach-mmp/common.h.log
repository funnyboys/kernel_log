    ARM: mmp: fix timer_init calls
    
    The change to passing the timer frequency as a function argument
    was a good idea, but caused a build failure for one user that
    was missed in the update:
    
    arch/arm/mach-mmp/time.c: In function 'mmp_dt_init_timer':
    arch/arm/mach-mmp/time.c:242:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'timer_init'; did you mean 'hrtimer_init'? [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
    
    Change that as well to fix the build error, and rename the
    function to put it into a proper namespace and make it clearer
    what is actually going on.
    
    I saw that the high 6500000 HZ frequency was previously only
    set with CONFIG_MMP2, but is now also used with MMP (pxa910),
    so I'm changing that back here. Please make sure that the
    frequencies are all correct now.

    ARM: mmp/mmp2: dt: enable the clock
    
    The device-tree booted MMP2 needs to enable the timer clock, otherwise
    it would stop ticking when the boot finishes.
    
    It can also use the clock rate from the clk, the non-DT boards need to
    keep using the hardcoded rates.

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    clk: mmp: stop using platform headers
    
    The mmp clock drivers currently hardcode the physical addresses for
    the clock registers. This is generally a bad idea, and it also gets in
    the way of multiplatform builds, which make the platform header files
    inaccessible to device drivers.
    
    To work around the header file problem, this patch changes the calling
    convention so the three mmp clock drivers get initialized with the base
    addresses as arguments from the platform code.
    
    It would still be useful to have a larger rework of the clock drivers,
    with DT integration to let the clocks actually be probed automatically,
    and the base addresses passed as DT properties. I am unsure if anyone
    is still interested in the mmp platform, so it is possible that this
    won't happen.

    ARM: delete struct sys_timer
    
    Now that the only field in struct sys_timer is .init, delete the struct,
    and replace the machine descriptor .timer field with the initialization
    function itself.
    
    This will enable moving timer drivers into drivers/clocksource without
    having to place a public prototype of each struct sys_timer object into
    include/linux; the intent is to create a single of_clocksource_init()
    function that determines which timer driver to initialize by scanning
    the device dtree, much like the proposed irqchip_init() at:

    [ARM] mmp2: add handling on PMIC IRQ
    
    Since PMIC INT pin is a special pin of CPU, the status of PMIC INT pin needs
    to be cleared after PMIC IRQ occured. Now append the clear operation in
    irq chip handler.

    [ARM] pxa: add base support for Marvell's PXA168 processor line
    
    """The Marvell® PXA168 processor is the first in a family of application
    processors targeted at mass market opportunities in computing and consumer
    devices. It balances high computing and multimedia performance with low
    power consumption to support extended battery life, and includes a wealth
    of integrated peripherals to reduce overall BOM cost .... """
    
    See http://www.marvell.com/featured/pxa168.jsp for more information.
    
      1. Marvell Mohawk core is a hybrid of xscale3 and its own ARM core,
         there are many enhancements like instructions for flushing the
         whole D-cache, and so on
    
      2. Clock reuses Russell's common clkdev, and added the basic support
         for UART1/2.
    
      3. Devices are a bit different from the 'mach-pxa' way, the platform
         devices are now dynamically allocated only when necessary (i.e.
         when pxa_register_device() is called). Description for each device
         are stored in an array of 'struct pxa_device_desc'. Now that:
    
         a. this array of device description is marked with __initdata and
            can be freed up system is fully up
    
         b. which means board code has to add all needed devices early in
            his initializing function
    
         c. platform specific data can now be marked as __initdata since
            they are allocated and copied by platform_device_add_data()
    
      4. only the basic UART1/2/3 are added, more devices will come later.
