commit 6a7d2c625656df5f8ad6e33aa3d164eefb1df8dc

    ARM: 7828/1: ARMv7-M: implement restart routine common to all v7-M machines
    
    The newly introduced function is to be used as .restart callback for
    ARMv7-M machines. The used register is architecturally defined, so it
    should work for all M-class machines.
