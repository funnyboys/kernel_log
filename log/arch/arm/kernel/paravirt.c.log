commit 5c83511bdb9832c86be20fb86b783356e2f58062
Author: Juergen Gross <jgross@suse.com>
Date:   Tue Aug 28 09:40:19 2018 +0200

    x86/paravirt: Use a single ops structure
    
    Instead of using six globally visible paravirt ops structures combine
    them in a single structure, keeping the original structures as
    sub-structures.
    
    This avoids the need to assemble struct paravirt_patch_template at
    runtime on the stack each time apply_paravirt() is being called (i.e.
    when loading a module).
    
    [ tglx: Made the struct and the initializer tabular for readability sake ]

commit 02c2433b3aa6b57313c261c9811bbbe49528101c

    arm: introduce CONFIG_PARAVIRT, PARAVIRT_TIME_ACCOUNTING and pv_time_ops
    
    Introduce CONFIG_PARAVIRT and PARAVIRT_TIME_ACCOUNTING on ARM.
    
    The only paravirt interface supported is pv_time_ops.steal_clock, so no
    runtime pvops patching needed.
    
    This allows us to make use of steal_account_process_tick for stolen
    ticks accounting.
