    Update Viresh Kumar's email address
    
    Switch to my kernel.org alias instead of a badly named gmail address,
    which I rarely use.

    ARM: spear: make clock driver independent of headers
    
    Device drivers should not access MMIO registers through hardcoded
    platform specific address constants. Instead, we can pass the
    MMIO token to the spear clock driver in the initialization routine
    to contain that knowledge in the platform code itself.
    
    Ideally, the clock driver would use of_iomap() or similar to
    get the address, and that can be used later, but for now, this
    is the minimal change.

    ARM: spear: move all files to mach-spear
    
    There are no conflicting files between the three mach-spear* directories
    and plat-spear any more, so we can now move all file to a common
    mach-spear directory.
