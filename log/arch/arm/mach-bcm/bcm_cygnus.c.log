    ARM: cygnus: fix const declaration bcm_cygnus_dt_compat
    
    The const declaration for char* is actually duplicated, however
    the array of strings is currently not constant. However, typically
    the dt_compat array is declared as const char *const. Follow
    that convention and also add the __initconst macro for constant
    initialization data.
