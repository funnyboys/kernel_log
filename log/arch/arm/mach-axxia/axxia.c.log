commit 543c5040f564c80fe59ae82a60fc061055d04a41
Author: Uwe Kleine-König <u.kleine-koenig@pengutronix.de>
Date:   Wed Feb 18 21:01:45 2015 +0100

    ARM: make arrays containing machine compatible strings const
    
    The definition
    
            static const char *axxia_dt_match[] __initconst = {
                    ...
    
    defines a changable array of constant strings. That is you must not do:
    
            *axxia_dt_match[0] = 'k';
    
    but
    
            axxia_dt_match[0] = "different string";
    
    is fine. So the annotation __initconst is wrong and yields a compiler
    error when other really const variables are added with __initconst.
    
    As the struct machine_desc member dt_compat is declared as
    
            const char *const *dt_compat;
    
    making the arrays const is the better alternative over changing all
    annotations to __initdata.

commit 1d22924e1c4e299337e86e290c02c3e3eb43b608
Author: Anders Berg <anders.berg@lsi.com>
Date:   Fri May 23 11:08:35 2014 +0200

    ARM: Add platform support for LSI AXM55xx SoC
    
    The AXM55xx family consists of devices that may contain up to 16 ARM Cortex-A15
    cores (in a 4x4 cluster configuration). The cores within each cluster share an
    L2 cache, and the clusters are connected to each other via a CCN-504 cache
    coherent interconnect.
    
    This machine requires CONFIG_ARM_LPAE enabled as all peripherals are located
    above 4GB in the memory map.
