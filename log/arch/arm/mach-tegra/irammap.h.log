    treewide: replace #include <asm/sizes.h> with #include <linux/sizes.h>
    
    Since commit dccd2304cc90 ("ARM: 7430/1: sizes.h: move from asm-generic
    to <linux/sizes.h>"), <asm/sizes.h> and <asm-generic/sizes.h> are just
    wrappers of <linux/sizes.h>.
    
    This commit replaces all <asm/sizes.h> and <asm-generic/sizes.h> to
    prepare for the removal.

    ARM: tegra: move resume vector define to irammap.h
    
    irammap.h's purpose is to define the layout/usage of IRAM. As such,
    TEGRA_IRAM_CODE_AREA should have been added there rather than iomap.h.
    Move the define, and rename it something more descriptive.

    ARM: tegra: decouple uncompress.h and debug-macro.S
    
    Prior to this change, Tegra's debug-macro.S relied on uncompress.h having
    determined which UART to use, and whether it was safe to use the UART
    (i.e. is it not in reset, and is clocked). This determination was
    communicated from uncompress.h to debug-macro.S using a few bytes of
    Tegra's IRAM (an on-SoC RAM). This had the disadvantage that uncompress.h
    was a required part of the kernel boot process; booting a non-compressed
    kernel would not allow earlyprintk to operate.
    
    This change duplicates the UART selection and validation logic into
    debug-macro.S so that the reliance on uncompress.h is removed.
    
    This also helps out with single-zImage work, since there is currently no
    support for using any uncompress.h with single-zImage.

    ARM: tegra: move irammap.h to mach-tegra
    
    Nothing outside mach-tegra uses this file, so there's no need for it to
    be in <mach/>.
    
    Since uncompress.h and debug-macro.S remain in include/mach, they need
    to include "../../irammap.h" becaue of this change. Both these usages
    will be removed shortly, when Tegra's DEBUG_LL implementation is updated
    not to pass information through IRAM.
