commit c6f54a9b39626090c934646f7d732e31b70ffce7

    ARM: 8113/1: remove remaining definitions of PLAT_PHYS_OFFSET from <mach/memory.h>
    
    The platforms selecting NEED_MACH_MEMORY_H defined the start address of
    their physical memory in the respective <mach/memory.h>. With
    ARM_PATCH_PHYS_VIRT=y (which is quite common today) this is useless
    though because the definition isn't used but determined dynamically.
    
    So remove the definitions from all <mach/memory.h> and provide the
    Kconfig symbol PHYS_OFFSET with the respective defaults in case
    ARM_PATCH_PHYS_VIRT isn't enabled.
    
    This allows to drop the dependency of PHYS_OFFSET on !NEED_MACH_MEMORY_H
    which prevents compiling an integrator nommu-kernel.
    (CONFIG_PAGE_OFFSET which has "default PHYS_OFFSET if !MMU" expanded to
    "0x" because CONFIG_PHYS_OFFSET doesn't exist as INTEGRATOR selects
    NEED_MACH_MEMORY_H.)

    ARM: P2V: separate PHYS_OFFSET from platform definitions
    
    This uncouple PHYS_OFFSET from the platform definitions, thereby
    facilitating run-time computation of the physical memory offset.

    [ARM] remove a common set of __virt_to_bus definitions
    
    Let's provide an overridable default instead of having every machine
    class define __virt_to_bus and __bus_to_virt to the same thing.  What
    most platforms are using is bus_addr == phys_addr so such is the default.
    
    One exception is ebsa110 which has no DMA what so ever, so the actual
    definition is not important except only for proper compilation.  Also
    added a comment about the special footbridge bus translation.
    
    Let's also remove comments alluding to set_dma_addr which is not
    (and should not) be commonly used.
