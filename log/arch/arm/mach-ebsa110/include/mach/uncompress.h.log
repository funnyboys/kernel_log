commit b632a30e8b9f861d543728443203e4c674610ed3
Author: Shawn Guo <shawn.guo@linaro.org>
Date:   Wed Dec 12 21:06:21 2012 +0800

    ARM: remove unused arch_decomp_wdog()
    
    With ARCH_HAS_DECOMP_WDOG removed from arch/arm/boot/compressed/decompress.c,
    all the arch_decomp_wdog() definition at platform level is unneeded.
    Remmove it.

    [ARM] Move include/asm-arm/arch-* to arch/arm/*/include/mach
    
    This just leaves include/asm-arm/plat-* to deal with.
