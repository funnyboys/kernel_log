commit 7a9caf59f60e55a8caf96f856713bd0ef0cc25a7

    ARM: mxs: stub out mxs_pm_init for !CONFIG_PM
    
    When building a kernel without CONFIG_PM, we get a link
    error from referencing mxs_pm_init in the machine
    descriptor. This defines a macro to NULL for that case.

    ARM: mxs: call mxs_pm_init() as a machine_desc hook
    
    The device_initcall is not a friend of multiplatform build.  Call
    mxs_pm_init() as a machine_desc hook instead of device_initcall.
