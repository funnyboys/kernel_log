commit e68f31f4520ea5d1ddbcaddb320ef0b4201eef3c
Author: Sebastian Hesselbarth <sebastian.hesselbarth@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Dec 13 16:42:19 2013 +0100

    ARM: 7922/1: l2x0: add Marvell Tauros3 support
    
    This adds support for the Marvell Tauros3 cache controller which
    is compatible with pl310 cache controller but broadcasts L1 cache
    operations to L2 cache. While updating the binding documentation,
    clean up the list of possible compatibles. Also reorder driver
    compatibles to allow non-ARM derivated to be compatible to ARM
    cache controller compatibles.
