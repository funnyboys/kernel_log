    mm/hugetlb: reduce arch dependent code about huge_pmd_unshare
    
    Currently we have many duplicates in definitions of huge_pmd_unshare.  In
    all architectures this function just returns 0 when
    CONFIG_ARCH_WANT_HUGE_PMD_SHARE is N.
    
    This patch puts the default implementation in mm/hugetlb.c and lets these
    architectures use the common code.

    mm/hugetlb: reduce arch dependent code around follow_huge_*
    
    Currently we have many duplicates in definitions around
    follow_huge_addr(), follow_huge_pmd(), and follow_huge_pud(), so this
    patch tries to remove the m.  The basic idea is to put the default
    implementation for these functions in mm/hugetlb.c as weak symbols
    (regardless of CONFIG_ARCH_WANT_GENERAL_HUGETL B), and to implement
    arch-specific code only when the arch needs it.
    
    For follow_huge_addr(), only powerpc and ia64 have their own
    implementation, and in all other architectures this function just returns
    ERR_PTR(-EINVAL).  So this patch sets returning ERR_PTR(-EINVAL) as
    default.
    
    As for follow_huge_(pmd|pud)(), if (pmd|pud)_huge() is implemented to
    always return 0 in your architecture (like in ia64 or sparc,) it's never
    called (the callsite is optimized away) no matter how implemented it is.
    So in such architectures, we don't need arch-specific implementation.
    
    In some architecture (like mips, s390 and tile,) their current
    arch-specific follow_huge_(pmd|pud)() are effectively identical with the
    common code, so this patch lets these architecture use the common code.
    
    One exception is metag, where pmd_huge() could return non-zero but it
    expects follow_huge_pmd() to always return NULL.  This means that we need
    arch-specific implementation which returns NULL.  This behavior looks
    strange to me (because non-zero pmd_huge() implies that the architecture
    supports PMD-based hugepage, so follow_huge_pmd() can/should return some
    relevant value,) but that's beyond this cleanup patch, so let's keep it.
    
    Justification of non-trivial changes:
    - in s390, follow_huge_pmd() checks !MACHINE_HAS_HPAGE at first, and this
      patch removes the check. This is OK because we can assume MACHINE_HAS_HPAGE
      is true when follow_huge_pmd() can be called (note that pmd_huge() has
      the same check and always returns 0 for !MACHINE_HAS_HPAGE.)
    - in s390 and mips, we use HPAGE_MASK instead of PMD_MASK as done in common
      code. This patch forces these archs use PMD_MASK, but it's OK because
      they are identical in both archs.
      In s390, both of HPAGE_SHIFT and PMD_SHIFT are 20.
      In mips, HPAGE_SHIFT is defined as (PAGE_SHIFT + PAGE_SHIFT - 3) and
      PMD_SHIFT is define as (PAGE_SHIFT + PAGE_SHIFT + PTE_ORDER - 3), but
      PTE_ORDER is always 0, so these are identical.

    hugetlb: restrict hugepage_migration_support() to x86_64
    
    Currently hugepage migration is available for all archs which support
    pmd-level hugepage, but testing is done only for x86_64 and there're
    bugs for other archs.  So to avoid breaking such archs, this patch
    limits the availability strictly to x86_64 until developers of other
    archs get interested in enabling this feature.
    
    Simply disabling hugepage migration on non-x86_64 archs is not enough to
    fix the reported problem where sys_move_pages() hits the BUG_ON() in
    follow_page(FOLL_GET), so let's fix this by checking if hugepage
    migration is supported in vma_migratable().

    mm: migrate: check movability of hugepage in unmap_and_move_huge_page()
    
    Currently hugepage migration works well only for pmd-based hugepages
    (mainly due to lack of testing,) so we had better not enable migration of
    other levels of hugepages until we are ready for it.
    
    Some users of hugepage migration (mbind, move_pages, and migrate_pages) do
    page table walk and check pud/pmd_huge() there, so they are safe.  But the
    other users (softoffline and memory hotremove) don't do this, so without
    this patch they can try to migrate unexpected types of hugepages.
    
    To prevent this, we introduce hugepage_migration_support() as an
    architecture dependent check of whether hugepage are implemented on a pmd
    basis or not.  And on some architecture multiple sizes of hugepages are
    available, so hugepage_migration_support() also checks hugepage size.

    This patch adds support for hugetlbfs based on the x86 implementation.
    It allows mapping of 2MB sections (see Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt
    for usage). The 64K pages configuration is not supported (section size
    is 512MB in this case).
