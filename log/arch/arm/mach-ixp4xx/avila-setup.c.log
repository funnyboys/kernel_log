    ARM: ixp4xx: Convert to SPARSE_IRQ
    
    This localizes the <mach/irqs.h> header to the mach-ixp4xx
    directory, removes NR_IRQS and switches IXP4xx over to using
    SPARSE_IRQ.
    
    This is a prerequisite for DT support.

    ARM: Fix i2c-gpio GPIO descriptor tables
    
    I used bad names in my clumsiness when rewriting many board
    files to use GPIO descriptors instead of platform data. A few
    had the platform_device ID set to -1 which would indeed give
    the device name "i2c-gpio".
    
    But several had it set to >=0 which gives the names
    "i2c-gpio.0", "i2c-gpio.1" ...
    
    Fix the offending instances in the ARM tree. Sorry for the
    mess.

    Pull i2c updates from Wolfram Sang:
     "This contains two bigger than usual tree-wide changes this time. They
      all have proper acks, caused no merge conflicts in linux-next where
      they have been for a while. They are namely:
    
       - to-gpiod conversion of the i2c-gpio driver and its users (touching
         arch/* and drivers/mfd/*)
    
       - adding a sbs-manager based on I2C core updates to SMBus alerts
         (touching drivers/power/*)
    
      Other notable changes:
    
       - i2c_boardinfo can now carry a dev_name to be used when the device
         is created. This is because some devices in ACPI world need fixed
         names to find the regulators.
    
       - the designware driver got a long discussed overhaul of its PM
         handling. img-scb and davinci got PM support, too.
    
       - at24 driver has way better OF support. And it has a new maintainer.

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd
Author: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    i2c: gpio: Augment all boardfiles to use open drain
    
    We now handle the open drain mode internally in the I2C GPIO
    driver, but we will get warnings from the gpiolib that we
    override the default mode of the line so it becomes open
    drain.
    
    We can fix all in-kernel users by simply passing the right
    flag along in the descriptor table, and we already touched
    all of these files in the series so let's just tidy it up.

    i2c: gpio: Convert to use descriptors
    
    This converts the GPIO-based I2C-driver to using GPIO
    descriptors instead of the old global numberspace-based
    GPIO interface. We:
    
    - Convert the driver to unconditionally grab two GPIOs
      from the device by index 0 (SDA) and 1 (SCL) which
      will work fine with device tree and descriptor tables.
      The existing device trees will continue to work just
      like before, but without any roundtrip through the
      global numberspace.
    
    - Brutally convert all boardfiles still passing global
      GPIOs by registering descriptor tables associated with
      the devices instead so this driver does not need to keep
      supporting passing any GPIO numbers as platform data.
    
    There is no stepwise approach as elegant as this, I
    strongly prefer this big hammer over any antsteps for this
    conversion. This way the old GPIO numbers go away and
    NEVER COME BACK.
    
    Special conversion for the different boards utilizing
    I2C-GPIO:
    
    - EP93xx (arch/arm/mach-ep93xx): pretty straight forward as
      all boards were using the same two GPIO lines, just define
      these two in a lookup table for "i2c-gpio" and register
      these along with the device. None of them define any
      other platform data so just pass NULL as platform data.
      This platform selects GPIOLIB so all should be smooth.
      The pins appear on a gpiochip for bank "G" as pins 1 (SDA)
      and 0 (SCL).
    
    - IXP4 (arch/arm/mach-ixp4): descriptor tables have to
      be registered for each board separately. They all use
      "IXP4XX_GPIO_CHIP" so it is pretty straight forward.
      Most board define no other platform data than SCL/SDA
      so they can drop the #include of <linux/i2c-gpio.h> and
      assign NULL to platform data.
    
      The "goramo_mlr" (Goramo Multilink Router) board is a bit
      worrisome: it implements its own I2C bit-banging in the
      board file, and optionally registers an I2C serial port,
      but claims the same GPIO lines for itself in the board file.
      This is not going to work: there will be competition for the
      GPIO lines, so delete the optional extra I2C bus instead, no
      I2C devices are registered on it anyway, there are just hints
      that it may contain an EEPROM that may be accessed from
      userspace. This needs to be fixed up properly by the serial
      clock using I2C emulation so drop a note in the code.
    
    - KS8695 board acs5k (arch/arm/mach-ks8695/board-acs5.c)
      has some platform data in addition to the pins so it needs to
      be kept around sans GPIO lines. Its GPIO chip is named
      "KS8695" and the arch selects GPIOLIB.
    
    - PXA boards (arch/arm/mach-pxa/*) use some of the platform
      data so it needs to be preserved here. The viper board even
      registers two GPIO I2Cs. The gpiochip is named "gpio-pxa" and
      the arch selects GPIOLIB.
    
    - SA1100 Simpad (arch/arm/mach-sa1100/simpad.c) defines a GPIO
      I2C bus, and the arch selects GPIOLIB.
    
    - Blackfin boards (arch/blackfin/bf533 etc) for these I assume
      their I2C GPIOs refer to the local gpiochip defined in
      arch/blackfin/kernel/bfin_gpio.c names "BFIN-GPIO".
      The arch selects GPIOLIB. The boards get spiked with
      IF_ENABLED(I2C_GPIO) but that is a side effect of it
      being like that already (I would just have Kconfig select
      I2C_GPIO and get rid of them all.) I also delete any
      platform data set to 0 as it will get that value anyway
      from static declartions of platform data.
    
    - The MIPS selects GPIOLIB and the Alchemy machine is using
      two local GPIO chips, one of them has a GPIO I2C. We need
      to adjust the local offset from the global number space here.
      The ATH79 has a proper GPIO driver in drivers/gpio/gpio-ath79.c
      and AFAICT the chip is named "ath79-gpio" and the PB44
      PCF857x expander spawns from this on GPIO 1 and 0. The latter
      board only use the platform data to specify pins so it can be
      cut altogether after this.
    
    - The MFD Silicon Motion SM501 is a special case. It dynamically
      spawns an I2C bus off the MFD using sm501_create_subdev().
      We use an approach to dynamically create a machine descriptor
      table and attach this to the "SM501-LOW" or "SM501-HIGH"
      gpiochip. We use chip-local offsets to grab the right lines.
      We can get rid of two local static inline helpers as part
      of this refactoring.

    ARM: delete struct sys_timer
    
    Now that the only field in struct sys_timer is .init, delete the struct,
    and replace the machine descriptor .timer field with the initialization
    function itself.
    
    This will enable moving timer drivers into drivers/clocksource without
    having to place a public prototype of each struct sys_timer object into
    include/linux; the intent is to create a single of_clocksource_init()
    function that determines which timer driver to initialize by scanning
    the device dtree, much like the proposed irqchip_init() at:
    http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg203686.html
    
    Includes mach-omap2 fixes from Igor Grinberg.

    Since we're now using addruart to establish the debug mapping, we can
    remove the io_pg_offst and phys_io members of struct machine_desc.
    
    The various declarations were removed using the following script:
    
      grep -rl MACHINE_START arch/arm | xargs \
      sed -i '/MACHINE_START/,/MACHINE_END/ { /\.\(phys_io\|io_pg_offst\)/d }'

Author: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>

    include cleanup: Update gfp.h and slab.h includes to prepare for breaking implicit slab.h inclusion from percpu.h
    
    percpu.h is included by sched.h and module.h and thus ends up being
    included when building most .c files.  percpu.h includes slab.h which
    in turn includes gfp.h making everything defined by the two files
    universally available and complicating inclusion dependencies.
    
    percpu.h -> slab.h dependency is about to be removed.  Prepare for
    this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those
    headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion
    needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is
    used as the basis of conversion.
    
      http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py
    
    The script does the followings.
    
    * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that
      only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,
      gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.
    
    * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include
      blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms
      to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains
      core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -
      alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there
      doesn't seem to be any matching order.
    
    * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly
      because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out
      an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the
      file.
    
    The conversion was done in the following steps.
    
    1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly
       over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h
       and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400
       files.
    
    2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,
       some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or
       embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added
       inclusions to around 150 files.
    
    3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits
       from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.
    
    4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.
       e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab
       APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.
    
    5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically
       editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h
       files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h
       inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually
       wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each
       slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as
       necessary.
    
    6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.
    
    7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures
       were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my
       distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few
       more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things
       build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).
    
       * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.
       * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig
       * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig
       * ia64 SMP allmodconfig
       * s390 SMP allmodconfig
       * alpha SMP allmodconfig
       * um on x86_64 SMP allmodconfig
    
    8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as
       a separate patch and serve as bisection point.
    
    Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step
    6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch.
    If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch
    headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of
    the specific arch.

    [ARM] 4033/1: Add separate Avila board setup code
    
    This patch adds support for the Gateworks Avila Network Platform in
    a separate set of setup files to the IXDP425. This is necessary now
    that a driver for the Avila CF card slot is available. It also adds
    support for a minor variant on the Avila board known as the Loft,
    which has a different number of maximum PCI devices.
