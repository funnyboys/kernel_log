    ARM/net: ixp4xx: Pass ethernet physical base as resource
    
    In order to probe this ethernet interface from the device tree
    all physical MMIO regions must be passed as resources. Begin
    this rewrite by first passing the port base address as a
    resource for all platforms using this driver, remap it in
    the driver and avoid using any reference of the statically
    mapped virtual address in the driver.

    ARM: ixp4xx: Convert to SPARSE_IRQ
    
    This localizes the <mach/irqs.h> header to the mach-ixp4xx
    directory, removes NR_IRQS and switches IXP4xx over to using
    SPARSE_IRQ.
    
    This is a prerequisite for DT support.

    ARM: Fix i2c-gpio GPIO descriptor tables
    
    I used bad names in my clumsiness when rewriting many board
    files to use GPIO descriptors instead of platform data. A few
    had the platform_device ID set to -1 which would indeed give
    the device name "i2c-gpio".
    
    But several had it set to >=0 which gives the names
    "i2c-gpio.0", "i2c-gpio.1" ...
    
    Fix the offending instances in the ARM tree. Sorry for the
    mess.

       - adding a sbs-manager based on I2C core updates to SMBus alerts

      Other notable changes:
    
       - i2c_boardinfo can now carry a dev_name to be used when the device
         is created. This is because some devices in ACPI world need fixed
         names to find the regulators.
    
       - the designware driver got a long discussed overhaul of its PM

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd
Author: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 1 15:07:57 2017 +0100

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    i2c: gpio: Augment all boardfiles to use open drain
    
    We now handle the open drain mode internally in the I2C GPIO
    driver, but we will get warnings from the gpiolib that we
    override the default mode of the line so it becomes open
    drain.
    
    We can fix all in-kernel users by simply passing the right
    flag along in the descriptor table, and we already touched
    all of these files in the series so let's just tidy it up.

    i2c: gpio: Convert to use descriptors
    
    This converts the GPIO-based I2C-driver to using GPIO
    descriptors instead of the old global numberspace-based
    GPIO interface. We:
    
    - Convert the driver to unconditionally grab two GPIOs
      from the device by index 0 (SDA) and 1 (SCL) which
      will work fine with device tree and descriptor tables.
      The existing device trees will continue to work just
      like before, but without any roundtrip through the
      global numberspace.
    
    - Brutally convert all boardfiles still passing global
      GPIOs by registering descriptor tables associated with
      the devices instead so this driver does not need to keep
      supporting passing any GPIO numbers as platform data.
    
    There is no stepwise approach as elegant as this, I
    strongly prefer this big hammer over any antsteps for this
    conversion. This way the old GPIO numbers go away and
    NEVER COME BACK.
    
    Special conversion for the different boards utilizing
    I2C-GPIO:
    
    - EP93xx (arch/arm/mach-ep93xx): pretty straight forward as
      all boards were using the same two GPIO lines, just define
      these two in a lookup table for "i2c-gpio" and register
      these along with the device. None of them define any
      other platform data so just pass NULL as platform data.
      This platform selects GPIOLIB so all should be smooth.
      The pins appear on a gpiochip for bank "G" as pins 1 (SDA)
      and 0 (SCL).
    
    - IXP4 (arch/arm/mach-ixp4): descriptor tables have to
      be registered for each board separately. They all use
      "IXP4XX_GPIO_CHIP" so it is pretty straight forward.
      Most board define no other platform data than SCL/SDA
      so they can drop the #include of <linux/i2c-gpio.h> and
      assign NULL to platform data.
    
      The "goramo_mlr" (Goramo Multilink Router) board is a bit
      worrisome: it implements its own I2C bit-banging in the
      board file, and optionally registers an I2C serial port,
      but claims the same GPIO lines for itself in the board file.
      This is not going to work: there will be competition for the
      GPIO lines, so delete the optional extra I2C bus instead, no
      I2C devices are registered on it anyway, there are just hints
      that it may contain an EEPROM that may be accessed from
      userspace. This needs to be fixed up properly by the serial
      clock using I2C emulation so drop a note in the code.
    
    - KS8695 board acs5k (arch/arm/mach-ks8695/board-acs5.c)
      has some platform data in addition to the pins so it needs to
      be kept around sans GPIO lines. Its GPIO chip is named
      "KS8695" and the arch selects GPIOLIB.
    
    - PXA boards (arch/arm/mach-pxa/*) use some of the platform
      data so it needs to be preserved here. The viper board even
      registers two GPIO I2Cs. The gpiochip is named "gpio-pxa" and
      the arch selects GPIOLIB.
    
    - SA1100 Simpad (arch/arm/mach-sa1100/simpad.c) defines a GPIO
      I2C bus, and the arch selects GPIOLIB.
    
    - Blackfin boards (arch/blackfin/bf533 etc) for these I assume
      their I2C GPIOs refer to the local gpiochip defined in
      arch/blackfin/kernel/bfin_gpio.c names "BFIN-GPIO".
      The arch selects GPIOLIB. The boards get spiked with
      IF_ENABLED(I2C_GPIO) but that is a side effect of it
      being like that already (I would just have Kconfig select
      I2C_GPIO and get rid of them all.) I also delete any
      platform data set to 0 as it will get that value anyway
      from static declartions of platform data.
    
    - The MIPS selects GPIOLIB and the Alchemy machine is using
      two local GPIO chips, one of them has a GPIO I2C. We need
      to adjust the local offset from the global number space here.
      The ATH79 has a proper GPIO driver in drivers/gpio/gpio-ath79.c
      and AFAICT the chip is named "ath79-gpio" and the PB44
      PCF857x expander spawns from this on GPIO 1 and 0. The latter
      board only use the platform data to specify pins so it can be
      cut altogether after this.
    
    - The MFD Silicon Motion SM501 is a special case. It dynamically
      spawns an I2C bus off the MFD using sm501_create_subdev().
      We use an approach to dynamically create a machine descriptor
      table and attach this to the "SM501-LOW" or "SM501-HIGH"
      gpiochip. We use chip-local offsets to grab the right lines.
      We can get rid of two local static inline helpers as part
      of this refactoring.

    ARM: ixp4xx: convert remaining users to use gpiolib
    
    A few call sites inside mach-ixp4xx were still using the custom
    ixp4xx GPIO API with gpio_line_* accessors, convert all these
    to use the standard gpiolib functions instead. Also attempt to
    request and label all GPIOs before use. Move the GPIO requests
    to per-machine device_initcalls() so we are not dependent on the
    GPIO chip to be available at machine_init time.

    ARM: delete struct sys_timer
    
    Now that the only field in struct sys_timer is .init, delete the struct,
    and replace the machine descriptor .timer field with the initialization
    function itself.
    
    This will enable moving timer drivers into drivers/clocksource without
    having to place a public prototype of each struct sys_timer object into
    include/linux; the intent is to create a single of_clocksource_init()
    function that determines which timer driver to initialize by scanning
    the device dtree, much like the proposed irqchip_init() at:
    http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg203686.html
    
    Includes mach-omap2 fixes from Igor Grinberg.

    Since we're now using addruart to establish the debug mapping, we can
    remove the io_pg_offst and phys_io members of struct machine_desc.
    
    The various declarations were removed using the following script:

      sed -i '/MACHINE_START/,/MACHINE_END/ { /\.\(phys_io\|io_pg_offst\)/d }'

    net: convert print_mac to %pM
    
    This converts pretty much everything to print_mac. There were
    a few things that had conflicts which I have just dropped for
    now, no harm done.
    
    I've built an allyesconfig with this and looked at the files
    that weren't built very carefully, but it's a huge patch.

    i2c: Convert most new-style drivers to use module aliasing
    
    Based on earlier work by Jon Smirl and Jochen Friedrich.
    
    Update most new-style i2c drivers to use standard module aliasing
    instead of the old driver_name/type driver matching scheme. I've
    left the video drivers apart (except for SoC camera drivers) as
    they're a bit more diffcult to deal with, they'll have their own
    patch later.

    [ARM] 4406/1: Trivial NSLU2 / NAS-100D header & setup code cleanup
    
    This trivial patch updates the nslu2 and nas-100d headers to
    remove pointless GPIO defines, and updates nslu2-setup.c
    accordingly. In addition minor style cleanups to some comments
    are included.

    This patch is required as the frequency fixup in nslu2_init does not
    run sufficiently early in the boot sequence to take effect. In addition
    the dsmg600 setup code behaviour has been improved such that a
    'fixup' routine is avoided.

    [ARM] 3597/1: ixp4xx/nslu2: Board support for new LED subsystem
    
    Patch from Rod Whitby
    
    This patch implements NEW_LEDS support for the Linksys NSLU2.  The
    NSLU2 has four LED indicators, which are the only form of output for
    an unmodified device - there is no keyboard or display on an NSLU2.
    For an NSLU2 which has been modified to bring out the serial port
    console, it is important to register that device first separately, to
    enable debugging of other device support.

    [ARM] 3140/1: NSLU2 machine support
    
    Patch from Alessandro Zummo
    
    This patch adds support for the LinkSys NSLU2 running with
    both big and little-endian kernels. The LinkSys NSLU2 is
    a cost engineered ARM, XScale 420 based system similar to
    the the Intel IXDP425 evaluation board. It uses the
    IXP4XX ARCH.
    
    While this patch applies independently of other patches
    the resultant kernel requires further patches to successfully
    use onboard devices, including the onboard flash. Since these
    patches are independent of this one they will be submitted
    separately.
    
    A defconfig is not included here because not all of
    the required drivers are actually in the kernel.
    We intend to provide one as soon as the patches
    will be incorporated in mainstream.
    
    This patch is the combined work of nslu2-linux.org
