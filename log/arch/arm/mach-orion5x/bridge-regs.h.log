    ARM: orion5x: clean up mach/*.h headers
    
    This is a simple move of all header files that are no longer
    included by anything else from the include/mach directory
    to the platform directory itself as preparation for
    multiplatform support.
    
    The mach/uncompress.h headers are left in place for now,
    and are mildly modified to be independent of the other
    headers. They will be removed entirely when ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM
    gets enabled and they become obsolete.
    
    Rather than updating the path names inside of the comments
    of each header, I delete those comments to avoid having to
    update them again, should they get moved or copied another
    time.
