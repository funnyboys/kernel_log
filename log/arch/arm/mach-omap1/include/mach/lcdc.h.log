commit 8d72c796c9d966b0efc26092dae7005c345b3efa
Author: Janusz Krzysztofik <jkrzyszt@tis.icnet.pl>
Date:   Fri Dec 11 16:16:36 2009 -0800

    omap1: LCD_DMA: Use some define rather than a hexadecimal
    
    The patch corrects the issue introduced with one of my earlier patches:
            OMAP: DMA: Fix omapfb/lcdc on OMAP1510 broken when PM set[1]
    as pointed out by OMAP subsystem maintainer.
    
    Applies on top of my prevoius patch:
      OMAP: DMA: move LCD DMA related code from plat-omap to mach-omap1[2]
    
    Tested on Amstrad Delta
    Compile tested with omap_generic_2420_defconfig
