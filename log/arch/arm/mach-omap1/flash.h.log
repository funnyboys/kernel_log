commit 100f9638fe7c291641418e33d08ff9a5b77803ac
Author: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>

    ARM: omap1: make headers more local
    
    Some header files are never included outside of a mach-omap1
    directory and do not need to be made visible in include/mach,
    so let's just move them all down one level.
