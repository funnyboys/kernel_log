commit 9138f89e7bb4b83ea0722f9912b96e236ece54cb
Author: Suman Anna <s-anna@ti.com>
Date:   Mon Feb 12 19:32:42 2018 -0600

    ARM: OMAP: Move plat/i2c.h into mach-omap1 folder
    
    The current contents of plat/i2c.h are only relevant for OMAP1
    platforms, as all the equivalent functions for OMAP2 has been
    dropped in commit 65fa3e719f36 ("ARM: OMAP2+: Remove legacy i2c.c
    platform init code"), and which has also moved the left-over code
    from plat-omap into mach-omap1. The hwmod is a concept only
    applicable for OMAP2 platforms, and the omap_i2c_reset() is
    already declared in mach-omap2/i2c.h. So, move the current
    plat/i2c.h header file into the mach-omap1 folder, and adjust
    the header usage accordingly.
