    ARM: OMAP1: Move dpll1 rates selection from config to runtime
    
    For still better multi-OMAP1 support, expand omap1_rate_table with flags
    for different SoC types and match them while selecting clock rates. The
    idea is stolen from current omap24xx clock rate selection algorithm.
    
    Since clkdev platform flag definitions are reused here, those had to be
    expanded with one extra entry for OMAP1710 subtype, as this is the only
    SoC for which we allow selection of the highest, 216 MHz rate.
    
    Once done, remove no longer needed clock rate configure time options.
    
    Tested on Amstrad Delta.

    OMAP1 clock: convert mach-omap1/clock.h to mach-omap1/clock_data.c
    
    The OMAP1 clock code currently #includes a large .h file full of static
    data structures.  Instead, define the data in a .c file.
    
    Russell King <linux@arm.linux.org.uk> proposed this new arrangement:
    
        http://marc.info/?l=linux-omap&m=125967425908895&w=2
    
    This patch also deals with most of the flagrant checkpatch violations.
    
    While here, separate the mpu_rate data structures out into their own
    files, opp.h and opp_data.c.  In the long run, these mpu_rate tables
    should be replaced with OPP code.
    
    Also includes a patch from Felipe Balbi <felipe.balbi@nokia.com> to
    mark omap1_clk_functions as __initdata to avoid a section warning:
