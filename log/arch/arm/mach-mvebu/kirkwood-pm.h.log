commit ba5a37e52194294d60e3d902a05c4471a93dbdee
Author: Andrew Lunn <andrew@lunn.ch>
Date:   Sat Feb 22 20:14:57 2014 +0100

    ARM: mvebu: Move kirkwood DT boards into mach-mvebu
    
    Move the kirkwood DT support into mach-mvebu, and make them part of
    ARCH_MULTI_V5. Minimal changes have been made in order to make it
    boot. Cleanup of the header files and integration with mvebu will
    take place in following patches.
    
    In order to help Debian transition between mach-kirkwood and
    mach-mvebu, the DTS files are compiled for both, allowing Debian to
    continue using mach-kirkwood until all remaining boards are supported
    by mach-mvebu. Debian is then expected to simply swap from
    mach-kirkwood to mach-mvebu and mach-kirkwood will be removed.
