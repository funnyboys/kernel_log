    ARM: OMAP: Move plat/i2c.h into mach-omap1 folder
    
    The current contents of plat/i2c.h are only relevant for OMAP1
    platforms, as all the equivalent functions for OMAP2 has been
    dropped in commit 65fa3e719f36 ("ARM: OMAP2+: Remove legacy i2c.c
    platform init code"), and which has also moved the left-over code
    from plat-omap into mach-omap1. The hwmod is a concept only
    applicable for OMAP2 platforms, and the omap_i2c_reset() is
    already declared in mach-omap2/i2c.h. So, move the current
    plat/i2c.h header file into the mach-omap1 folder, and adjust
    the header usage accordingly.

    ARM: OMAP2+: Cleanup omap_i2c_dev_attr usage
    
    The omap_i2c_dev_attr data was used to supply instance-specific
    data for legacy non-DT devices. The I2C legacy device support has
    been cleaned up in commit 65fa3e719f36 ("ARM: OMAP2+: Remove legacy
    i2c.c platform init code") and this data is therefore no longer
    needed. So, cleanup the structure and all the associated data in
    various hwmod data files.
    
    The i2c-omap.h header is still needed because of the need for
    various OMAP_I2C_IP_VERSION_x macros.

    ARM: OMAP: Fix relative includes for shared i2c.h file
    
    As discussed on linux-arm-kernel, we want to avoid
    relative includes for the arch/arm/*omap* shared code:
    
    http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-omap/msg80520.html
    
    To fix this for the shared i2c.h, let's re-introduce
    a minimal plat/i2c.h.
    
    Note that drivers must not use this header as it will
    break build for omap2+ CONFIG_MULTIPLATFORM builds.

    ARM: OMAP: Split plat-omap/i2c.c into mach-omap1 and mach-omap2
    
    There's no need to keep the device related things in the
    common i2c.c as omap2+ is using hwmod. Split the code to
    mach-omap1 and mach-omap2 parts and only leave common
    code to plat-omap/i2c.c.
    
    Note that as omap1 only has one i2c controller, we can
    now remove the old device related macros.
