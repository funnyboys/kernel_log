    ARM: lpc18xx: add basic support for NXP LPC18xx/43xx SoCs
    
    Add support for NXP's LPC18xx (Cortex-M3) and LPC43xx (Cortex-M4)
    SoCs. These SoCs are NXP's high preformance MCU line and can run at
    clock speeds up to 180 MHz for LPC18xx and 204 MHz for LPC43xx.
    
    LPC43xx is more or less a LPC18xx with a Cortex-M4F core and a few
    extra peripherals. The LPC43xx series also features one or two
    Cortex-M0 cores that can be used to offload the main M4 core.
