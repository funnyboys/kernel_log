    ARM: decompressor: fix warning introduced in fortify patch
    
    Commit ee333554fed5 ("ARM: 8749/1: Kconfig: Add ARCH_HAS_FORTIFY_SOURCE")
    introduced a new warning:
    
    arch/arm/boot/compressed/misc.c: In function 'fortify_panic':
    arch/arm/boot/compressed/misc.c:167:1: error: 'noreturn' function does return [-Werror]
    
    The simple solution would be to make 'error' a noreturn function, but
    this causes a prototype mismatch as the function is prototyped in
    several .c files.  So, move the function prototype to a new header.
    
    There are also a couple of variables that are also declared in several
    locations.  Clean this up while we are here.
