    ARM: iop32x: merge everything into mach-iop32x/
    
    Various bits of iop32x are now in their traditional locations in plat-iop,
    mach-iop/include/mach/ and in include/asm/mach/hardware. As nothing
    outside of the iop32x mach code references these any more, this can all
    be moved into one place now.
    
    The only remaining things in the include/mach/ directory are now the
    NR_IRQS definition, the entry-macros.S file and the the decompressor
    uart access. After the irqchip code has been converted to SPARSE_IRQ
    and GENERIC_IRQ_MULTI_HANDLER, it can be moved to ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM.
