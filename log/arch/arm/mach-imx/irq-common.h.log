commit 81efe0fc67c72ca13eb402cc6de5c79f0f258932
Author: Uwe Kleine-König <u.kleine-koenig@pengutronix.de>

    ARM: imx: drop support for irq priorisation
    
    The code for irq priorisation support doesn't have any in-tree users and
    the Kconfig description does wrong promises because nowadays irq
    handlers are called with irqs disabled, so no high prioritized irq can
    interrupt a lower prioritized handler.

    ARM: imx: remove header file mach/irqs.h
    
    The only mach/irqs.h user outside arch/arm/mach-imx is
    sound/soc/fsl/imx-pcm-fiq.c, which refers to mxc_set_irq_fiq().
    Move the declaration into include/linux/platform_data/asoc-imx-ssi.h,
    so that we can remove mach/irqs.h includsion from imx-pcm-fiq.c.
    
    Inside arch/arm/mach-imx, the only users to mach/irqs.h are avic.c
    and tzic.c for referring to macro FIQ_START.  Let's move the macro
    into irq-common.h and get rid of mach/irqs.h completely.

    ARM: imx: merge plat-mxc into mach-imx
    
    It's really unnecessary to have plat-mxc, and let's merge it into
    mach-imx.  It's pretty much just a bunch of file renaming and
    Kconfig/Makefile merge.
    
    To make the change less invasive, we keep using Kconfig symbol
    CONFIG_ARCH_MXC for mach-imx sub-architecture.
