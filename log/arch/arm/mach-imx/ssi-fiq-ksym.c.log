commit 8478132a8784605fe07ede555f7277d989368d73
Author: Russell King <rmk+kernel@armlinux.org.uk>
Date:   Wed Nov 23 10:00:03 2016 +0000

    Revert "arm: move exports to definitions"
    
    This reverts commit 4dd1837d7589f468ed109556513f476e7a7f9121.
    
    Moving the exports for assembly code into the assembly files breaks
    KSYM trimming, but also breaks modversions.
    
    While fixing the KSYM trimming is trivial, fixing modversions brings
    us to a technically worse position that we had prior to the above
    change:
    
    - We end up with the prototype definitions divorsed from everything
      else, which means that adding or removing assembly level ksyms
      become more fragile:
      * if adding a new assembly ksyms export, a missed prototype in
        asm-prototypes.h results in a successful build if no module in
        the selected configuration makes use of the symbol.
      * when removing a ksyms export, asm-prototypes.h will get forgotten,
        with armksyms.c, you'll get a build error if you forget to touch
        the file.
    
    - We end up with the same amount of include files and prototypes,
      they're just in a header file instead of a .c file with their
      exports.
    
    As for lines of code, we don't get much of a size reduction:
     (original commit)
     47 files changed, 131 insertions(+), 208 deletions(-)
     (fix for ksyms trimming)
     7 files changed, 18 insertions(+), 5 deletions(-)
     (two fixes for modversions)
     1 file changed, 34 insertions(+)
     3 files changed, 7 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
    which results in a net total of only 25 lines deleted.
    
    As there does not seem to be much benefit from this change of approach,
    revert the change.

commit 3995eb82050a81e11217a0b88b2a5eddd53eb4d6

    ARM: imx: merge plat-mxc into mach-imx
    
    It's really unnecessary to have plat-mxc, and let's merge it into
    mach-imx.  It's pretty much just a bunch of file renaming and
    Kconfig/Makefile merge.
    
    To make the change less invasive, we keep using Kconfig symbol
    CONFIG_ARCH_MXC for mach-imx sub-architecture.
