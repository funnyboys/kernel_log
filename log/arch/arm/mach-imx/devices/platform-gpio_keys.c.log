commit 87dfb311b707cd4c4b666c9af0fa15acbe6eee99
Author: Masahiro Yamada <yamada.masahiro@socionext.com>
Date:   Tue May 14 15:46:51 2019 -0700

    treewide: replace #include <asm/sizes.h> with #include <linux/sizes.h>
    
    Since commit dccd2304cc90 ("ARM: 7430/1: sizes.h: move from asm-generic
    to <linux/sizes.h>"), <asm/sizes.h> and <asm-generic/sizes.h> are just
    wrappers of <linux/sizes.h>.
    
    This commit replaces all <asm/sizes.h> and <asm-generic/sizes.h> to
    prepare for the removal.

commit 50f2de61269bbe2f40bead1969a9594fa8599b93

    ARM: imx: include hardware.h rather than mach/hardware.h
    
    It moves a bunch of header files included in hardware.h and itself
    from mach-imx/include/mach to mach-imx, and updates users to include
    hardware.h rather than mach/hardware.h.  The files in mach-imx/devices
    will need to include "../hardware.h".

    ARM: imx: move platform device code into mach-imx
    
    It moves platform device code from plat-mxc into mach-imx.  Along with
    that, header devices-common.h gets moved from plat-mxc/include/mach/
    into mach-imx/devices/.
