    ARM: opcodes: add __ERET/__MSR_ELR_HYP instruction encoding
    
    Enabling boot from HYP mode requires the use of some more
    virt-specific instructions ("eret" and "msr elr_hyp, reg").
    
    Add the necessary encoding to asm/opcode-virt.h.

    ARM: 7511/1: opcodes: Opcode definitions for the Virtualization Extensions
    
    For now, this patch just adds a definition for the HVC instruction.
    More can be added here later, as needed.
    
    Now that we have a real example of how to use the opcode injection
    macros properly, this patch also adds a cross-reference from the
    explanation in opcodes.h (since without an example, figuring out
    how to use the macros is not that easy).
