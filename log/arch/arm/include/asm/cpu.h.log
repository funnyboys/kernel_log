    ARM: kernel: add MIDR to per-CPU information data
    
    The advent of big.LITTLE ARM platforms requires the kernel to be able
    to identify the MIDRs of all online CPUs upon request. MIDRs are stashed
    at boot time so that kernel subsystems can detect the MIDR of online CPUs
    by simply retrieving per-CPU data updated by all booted CPUs.

    ARM: 5872/1: ARM: include needed linux/cpu.h in asm/cpu.h
    
    The file arch/arm/include/asm/cpu.h needs to include 'linux/cpu.h' to
    meet its dependency. Otherwise when using "struct cpuinfo_arm" and
    including just 'asm/cpu.h' throws below error -
            arch/arm/include/asm/cpu.h:16: error: field 'cpu' has incomplete type
    
    To fix this  otherway, one can also include both linux/cpu.h and
    asm/cpu.h but it shoudn't be that way.  So this patch fixes this by
    including the linux/cpu.h in asm/cpu.h, so that including alone
    asm/cpu.h is enough.

    [ARM] move include/asm-arm to arch/arm/include/asm
    
    Move platform independent header files to arch/arm/include/asm, leaving
    those in asm/arch* and asm/plat* alone.
