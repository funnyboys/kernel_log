    arm: switch to csum_and_copy_from_user()
    
    Note that csum_partial_copy_from_user() is in assembler here,
    so I'm leaving it alone and just providing the wrapper for
    it.  When/if we go for switching arm to user_access_{begin,end}()
    (doing domain switches in those), somebody well need to look
    into that one.

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    ipv6: Pass proto to csum_ipv6_magic as __u8 instead of unsigned short
    
    This patch updates csum_ipv6_magic so that it correctly recognizes that
    protocol is a unsigned 8 bit value.
    
    This will allow us to better understand what limitations may or may not be
    present in how we handle the data.  For example there are a number of
    places that call htonl on the protocol value.  This is likely not necessary
    and can be replaced with a multiplication by ntohl(1) which will be
    converted to a shift by the compiler.

    ipv4: Update parameters for csum_tcpudp_magic to their original types
    
    This patch updates all instances of csum_tcpudp_magic and
    csum_tcpudp_nofold to reflect the types that are usually used as the source
    inputs.  For example the protocol field is populated based on nexthdr which
    is actually an unsigned 8 bit value.  The length is usually populated based
    on skb->len which is an unsigned integer.
    
    This addresses an issue in which the IPv6 function csum_ipv6_magic was
    generating a checksum using the full 32b of skb->len while
    csum_tcpudp_magic was only using the lower 16 bits.  As a result we could
    run into issues when attempting to adjust the checksum as there was no
    protocol agnostic way to update it.
    
    With this change the value is still truncated as many architectures use
    "(len + proto) << 8", however this truncation only occurs for values
    greater than 16776960 in length and as such is unlikely to occur as we stop
    the inner headers at ~64K in size.
    
    I did have to make a few minor changes in the arm, mn10300, nios2, and
    score versions of the function in order to support these changes as they
    were either using things such as an OR to combine the protocol and length,
    or were using ntohs to convert the length which would have truncated the
    value.
    
    I also updated a few spots in terms of whitespace and type differences for
    the addresses.  Most of this was just to make sure all of the definitions
    were in sync going forward.

    ARM: fix csum_tcpudp_magic() miscompilation
    
    There is a miscompilation of csum_tcpudp_magic() due to the way we pass
    the asm() operands in.  Fortunately, this doesn't affect the IP code,
    but can affect anyone who passes ntohs(udp->len) as the length argument,
    or protocols with more than 8 bits.
    
    The problem stems from passing 16-bit operands into an asm() - GCC makes
    no guarantees about what may be in the high 16-bits of such a register
    passed into assembly which is in the "HI" machine mode.
    
    Address this by changing the way we handle the 16-bit arguments - since
    accumulating the protocol and length can never overflow, we can delegate
    this to the compiler to perform, and then accumulate it into the
    checksum inside the asm(), taking account of the endian-ness via an
    appropriate 32-bit rotation.
    
    While we are here, also realise that there's a chance to optimise this
    a little: several callers from IP code pass a constant zero as the
    initial sum.  This is wasteful - if we detect this condition, we can
    optimise away one instruction.
