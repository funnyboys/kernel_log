    KVM: arm/arm64: Add kvm_ras.h to collect kvm specific RAS plumbing
    
    To split up APEIs in_nmi() path, the caller needs to always be
    in_nmi(). KVM shouldn't have to know about this, pull the RAS plumbing
    out into a header file.
    
    Currently guest synchronous external aborts are claimed as RAS
    notifications by handle_guest_sea(), which is hidden in the arch codes
    mm/fault.c. 32bit gets a dummy declaration in system_misc.h.
    
    There is going to be more of this in the future if/when the kernel
    supports the SError-based firmware-first notification mechanism and/or
    kernel-first notifications for both synchronous external abort and
    SError. Each of these will come with some Kconfig symbols and a
    handful of header files.
    
    Create a header file for all this.
    
    This patch gives handle_guest_sea() a 'kvm_' prefix, and moves the
    declarations to kvm_ras.h as preparation for a future patch that moves
    the ACPI-specific RAS code out of mm/fault.c.

    ARM: spectre-v2: harden user aborts in kernel space
    
    In order to prevent aliasing attacks on the branch predictor,
    invalidate the BTB or instruction cache on CPUs that are known to be
    affected when taking an abort on a address that is outside of a user
    task limit:
    
    Cortex A8, A9, A12, A17, A73, A75: flush BTB.
    Cortex A15, Brahma B15: invalidate icache.
    
    If the IBE bit is not set, then there is little point to enabling the
    workaround.

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    arm/arm64: KVM: add guest SEA support
    
    Currently external aborts are unsupported by the guest abort
    handling. Add handling for SEAs so that the host kernel reports
    SEAs which occur in the guest kernel.
    
    When an SEA occurs in the guest kernel, the guest exits and is
    routed to kvm_handle_guest_abort(). Prior to this patch, a print
    message of an unsupported FSC would be printed and nothing else
    would happen. With this patch, the code gets routed to the APEI
    handling of SEAs in the host kernel to report the SEA information.

    Merge tag 'split-asm_system_h-for-linus-20120328' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dhowells/linux-asm_system
    
    Pull "Disintegrate and delete asm/system.h" from David Howells:
     "Here are a bunch of patches to disintegrate asm/system.h into a set of
      separate bits to relieve the problem of circular inclusion
      dependencies.
    
      I've built all the working defconfigs from all the arches that I can
      and made sure that they don't break.
    
      The reason for these patches is that I recently encountered a circular
      dependency problem that came about when I produced some patches to
      optimise get_order() by rewriting it to use ilog2().
    
      This uses bitops - and on the SH arch asm/bitops.h drags in
      asm-generic/get_order.h by a circuituous route involving asm/system.h.
    
      The main difficulty seems to be asm/system.h.  It holds a number of
      low level bits with no/few dependencies that are commonly used (eg.
      memory barriers) and a number of bits with more dependencies that
      aren't used in many places (eg.  switch_to()).
    
      These patches break asm/system.h up into the following core pieces:
    
        (1) asm/barrier.h
    
            Move memory barriers here.  This already done for MIPS and Alpha.
    
        (2) asm/switch_to.h
    
            Move switch_to() and related stuff here.
    
        (3) asm/exec.h
    
            Move arch_align_stack() here.  Other process execution related bits
            could perhaps go here from asm/processor.h.
    
        (4) asm/cmpxchg.h
    
            Move xchg() and cmpxchg() here as they're full word atomic ops and
            frequently used by atomic_xchg() and atomic_cmpxchg().
    
        (5) asm/bug.h
    
            Move die() and related bits.
    
        (6) asm/auxvec.h
    
            Move AT_VECTOR_SIZE_ARCH here.
    
      Other arch headers are created as needed on a per-arch basis."
    
    Fixed up some conflicts from other header file cleanups and moving code
    around that has happened in the meantime, so David's testing is somewhat
    weakened by that.  We'll find out anything that got broken and fix it..
