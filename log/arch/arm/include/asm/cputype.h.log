    Pull ARM spectre updates from Russell King:
     "These are the currently known final bits that resolve the Spectre
      issues. big.Little systems used to be sufficiently identical in that
      there were no differences between individual CPUs in the system that
      mattered to the kernel. With the advent of the Spectre problem, the
      CPUs now have differences in how the workaround is applied.
    
      As a result of previous Spectre patches, these systems ended up
      reporting quite a lot of:
    
         "CPUx: Spectre v2: incorrect context switching function, system vulnerable"
    
      messages due to the action of the big.Little switcher causing the CPUs
      to be re-initialised regularly. This series resolves that issue by
      making the CPU vtable unique to each CPU.
    
      However, since this is used very early, before per-cpu is setup,
      per-cpu can't be used. We also have a problem that two of the methods
      are not called from preempt-safe paths, but thankfully these remain
      identical between all CPUs in the system. To make sure, we validate
      that these are identical during boot"

    ARM: split out processor lookup
    
    Split out the lookup of the processor type and associated error handling
    from the rest of setup_processor() - we will need to use this in the
    secondary CPU bringup path for big.Little Spectre variant 2 mitigation.

    Pull ARM SoC platform updates from Olof Johansson:
     "Here are the main updates for SoC support (besides DT additions) for
      ARM 32- and 64-bit platforms. The branch also contains defconfig
      updates to turn on drivers and options as needed on the various
      platforms.
    
      The largest parts of the delta are from cleanups moving platform data
      and board file setup of TI platforms to ti-sysc bus drivers. There are
      also some sweeping changes of eeprom and nand setup on Davinci, i.MX
      and other platforms.
    
      Samsung is removing support for Exynos5440, which was an oddball SoC
      that hasn't been seen much use in designs.
    
      Renesas is adding support for new SoCs (R-Car E3, RZ/G1C and RZ/N1D).

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd
Author: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 1 15:07:57 2017 +0100

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    ARM: 8634/1: hw_breakpoint: blacklist Scorpion CPUs
    
    On APQ8060, the kernel crashes in arch_hw_breakpoint_init, taking an
    undefined instruction trap within write_wb_reg. This is because Scorpion
    CPUs erroneously appear to set DBGPRSR.SPD when WFI is issued, even if
    the core is not powered down. When DBGPRSR.SPD is set, breakpoint and
    watchpoint registers are treated as undefined.
    
    It's possible to trigger similar crashes later on from userspace, by
    requesting the kernel to install a breakpoint or watchpoint, as we can
    go idle at any point between the reset of the debug registers and their
    later use. This has always been the case.
    
    Given that this has always been broken, no-one has complained until now,
    and there is no clear workaround, disable hardware breakpoints and
    watchpoints on Scorpion to avoid these issues.

    ARM: make xscale iwmmxt code multiplatform aware
    
    In a multiplatform configuration, we may end up building a kernel for
    both Marvell PJ1 and an ARMv4 CPU implementation. In that case, the
    xscale-cp0 code is built with gcc -march=armv4{,t}, which results in a
    build error from the coprocessor instructions.
    
    Since we know this code will only have to run on an actual xscale
    processor, we can simply build the entire file for ARMv5TE.
    
    Related to this, we need to handle the iWMMXT initialization sequence
    differently during boot, to ensure we don't try to touch xscale
    specific registers on other CPUs from the xscale_cp0_init initcall.
    cpu_is_xscale() used to be hardcoded to '1' in any configuration that
    enables any XScale-compatible core, but this breaks once we can have a
    combined kernel with MMP1 and something else.
    
    In this patch, I replace the existing cpu_is_xscale() macro with a new
    cpu_is_xscale_family() macro that evaluates true for xscale, xsc3 and
    mohawk, which makes the behavior more deterministic.
    
    The two existing users of cpu_is_xscale() are modified accordingly,
    but slightly change behavior for kernels that enable CPU_MOHAWK without
    also enabling CPU_XSCALE or CPU_XSC3. Previously, these would leave leave
    PMD_BIT4 in the page tables untouched, now they clear it as we've always
    done for kernels that enable both MOHAWK and the support for the older
    CPU types.
    
    Since the previous behavior was inconsistent, I assume it was
    unintentional.

    ARM: 8130/1: cpuidle/cpuidle-big_little: fix reading cpu id part number
    
    Commit af040ffc9ba1 ("ARM: make it easier to check the CPU part number
    correctly") changed ARM_CPU_PART_X masks, and the way they are returned and
    checked against. Usage of read_cpuid_part_number() is now deprecated, and
    calling places updated accordingly. This actually broke cpuidle-big_little
    initialization, as bl_idle_driver_init() performs a check using an hardcoded
    mask on cpu_id.
    
    Create an interface to perform the check (that is now even easier to read).
    Define also a proper mask (ARM_CPU_PART_MASK) that makes this kind of checks
    cleaner and helps preventing bugs in the future. Update usage accordingly.

    ARM: make it easier to check the CPU part number correctly
    
    Ensure that platform maintainers check the CPU part number in the right
    manner: the CPU part number is meaningless without also checking the
    CPU implement(e|o)r (choose your preferred spelling!)  Provide an
    interface which returns both the implementer and part number together,
    and update the definitions to include the implementer.
    
    Mark the old function as being deprecated... indeed, using the old
    function with the definitions will now always evaluate as false, so
    people must update their un-merged code to the new function.  While
    this could be avoided by adding new definitions, we'd also have to
    create new names for them which would be awkward.

    ARM: 8041/1: pj4: fix cpu_is_pj4 check
    
    Commit fdb487f5c961b94486a78fa61fa28b8eff1954ab
      ("ARM: 8015/1: Add cpu_is_pj4 to distinguish PJ4 because it
        has some differences with V7")
    introduced a cpuid check for Marvell PJ4 processors to fix a
    regression caused by adding PJ4 based Marvell Dove into
    multi_v7.
    
    Unfortunately, this check is too narrow to catch PJ4 used on
    Dove itself and breaks iWMMXt support.
    
    This patch therefore relaxes the cpuid mask to match both PJ4
    and PJ4B. Also, rework the given comment about PJ4/PJ4B
    modifications to be a little bit more specific about the
    differences.

    ARM: 7940/1: add support for the Cortex-A12 processor
    
    The A12 behaves as the A7/A15 does with respect to setting the SMP bit, and
    doesn't require TLB ops broadcasting to be explicitly enabled like the A9 does.
    
    Note that as the ACTLR cannot (usually) be written from non-secure, it is the
    responsibility of the bootloader/firmware to set this bit per core - it is
    done here in Linux as last resort in case of bad firmware.

    ARM: 7801/1: v6: prevent gcc 4.5 from reordering extended CP15 reads above is_smp() test
    
    Commit 621a0147d5c921f4cc33636ccd0602ad5d7cbfbc ("ARM: 7757/1: mm:
    don't flush icache in switch_mm with hardware broadcasting") breaks
    the boot on OMAP2430SDP with omap2plus_defconfig.  Tracked to an
    undefined instruction abort from the CP15 read in
    cache_ops_need_broadcast().  It turns out that gcc 4.5 reorders the
    extended CP15 read above the is_smp() test.  This breaks ARM1136 r0
    cores, since they don't support several CP15 registers that later ARM
    cores do.  ARM1136JF-S TRM section 3.2.1 "Register allocation" has the
    details.
    
    So mark the extended CP15 read as clobbering memory, which prevents
    the compiler from reordering it before the is_smp() test.  Russell
    states that the code generated from this approach is preferable to
    marking the inline asm as volatile.  Remove the existing condition
    code clobber as it's obsolete, per Nico's post:

    The __cpu_logical_map array is statically initialized to 0, which is a valid
    MPIDR value. To prevent issues with the current implementation, this patch
    defines an MPIDR_INVALID value, and statically initializes the
    __cpu_logical_map[] array to it. Entries in the arm_dt_init_cpu_maps()
    tmp_map array used to stash DT reg properties while parsing DT are initialized
    with the MPIDR_INVALID value as well for consistency.

    Add SCTLR bit 17, (CR_BR - Background Region bit) to the list of CR_*
    bitfields. This bit determines whether to use the architecturally defined
    memory map
    
    Add the MPUIR to the available registers when using read_cpuid macro. The
    MPUIR is the MPU type register.

    ARM: Add base support for ARMv7-M
    
    This patch adds the base support for the ARMv7-M
    architecture. It consists of the corresponding arch/arm/mm/ files and
    various #ifdef's around the kernel. Exception handling is implemented by
    a subsequent patch.
    
    [ukleinek: squash in some changes originating from commit

    from the v2.6.33-arm1 patch stack, port to post 3.6, drop zImage
    support, drop reorganisation of pt_regs, assert CONFIG_CPU_V7M doesn't
    leak into installed headers and a few cosmetic changes]

    ARM: stub out read_cpuid and read_cpuid_ext for CPU_CP15=n
    
    Traditionally for !CPU_CP15 read_cpuid and read_cpuid_ext returned the
    processor id independent of the parameter passed in. This is wrong of
    course but theoretically this doesn't harm because it's only called on
    machines having a cp15.
    
    Instead return 0 unconditionally which might make unused code paths be
    better optimizable and so smaller and warn about unexpected usage.

    ARM: kernel: enhance MPIDR macro definitions
    
    Kernel subsystems other than the topology layer need the MPIDR
    mask definitions to access the MPIDR without relying on hardcoded
    masks. This patch moves the MPIDR register masks definition to
    a header file and defines a macro to simplify access to MPIDR bit fields
    representing affinity levels.

    ARM: 7011/1: Add ARM cpu topology definition
    
    The affinity between ARM processors is defined in the MPIDR register.
    We can identify which processors are in the same cluster,
    and which ones have performance interdependency. We can define the
    cpu topology of ARM platform, that is then used by sched_mc and sched_smt.
    
    The default state of sched_mc and sched_smt config is disable.
    When enabled, the behavior of the scheduler can be modified with
    sched_mc_power_savings and sched_smt_power_savings sysfs interfaces.
    
    Changes since v4 :
    *  Remove unnecessary parentheses and blank lines
    
    Changes since v3 :
    * Update the format of printk message
    * Remove blank line
    
    Changes since v2 :
    * Update the commit message and some comments
    
    Changes since v1 :
    * Update the commit message
    * Add read_cpuid_mpidr in arch/arm/include/asm/cputype.h
    * Modify header of arch/arm/kernel/topology.c
    * Modify tests and manipulation of MPIDR's bitfields
    * Modify the place and dependancy of the config
    * Modify Noop functions

    Check whether the TLB operations need broadcasting on SMP systems
    
    ARMv7 SMP hardware can handle the TLB maintenance operations
    broadcasting in hardware so that the software can avoid the costly IPIs.
    This patch adds the necessary checks (the MMFR3 CPUID register) to avoid
    the broadcasting if already supported by the hardware.
    
    (this patch is based on the work done by Tony Thompson @ ARM)

commit 0ba8b9b273c45dd23f60ff700e265a0069b33758
Author: Russell King <rmk@dyn-67.arm.linux.org.uk>
Date:   Sun Aug 10 18:08:10 2008 +0100

    [ARM] cputype: separate definitions, use them
    
    Add asm/cputype.h, moving functions and definitions from asm/system.h
    there.  Convert all users of 'processor_id' to the more efficient
    read_cpuid_id() function.
