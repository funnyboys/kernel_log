commit af965acc81796c0006c0200129cd22a27c714e52
Author: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>
Date:   Wed Dec 12 19:16:59 2012 +0000

    ARM: opcodes: add opcodes definitions for ARM security extensions
    
    The ARM security extensions introduced the smc instruction, which is not
    supported by all versions of GAS.
    
    This patch introduces opcodes-sec.h, so that smc is made available in a
    similar manner to hvc.
