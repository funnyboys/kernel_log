commit dcfdae04bd92e8a2ea155db0e21e3bddc09e0a89
Author: Catalin Marinas <catalin.marinas@arm.com>
Date:   Tue Nov 22 17:30:29 2011 +0000

    ARM: LPAE: Introduce the 3-level page table format definitions
    
    This patch introduces the pgtable-3level*.h files with definitions
    specific to the LPAE page table format (3 levels of page tables).
    
    Each table is 4KB and has 512 64-bit entries. An entry can point to a
    40-bit physical address. The young, write and exec software bits share
    the corresponding hardware bits (negated). Other software bits use spare
    bits in the PTE.
    
    The patch also changes some variable types from unsigned long or int to
    pteval_t or pgprot_t.
