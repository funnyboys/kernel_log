commit 3acf731ccad039d91721b6cd9fc85569e9f958ca
Author: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>

    ARM: davinci: make headers more local
    
    Some header files are never included outside of a mach-davinci
    directory and do not need to be made visible in include/mach,
    so let's just move them all down one level.
