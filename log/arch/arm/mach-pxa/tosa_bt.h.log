commit 4c25c5d2985c1db482cfe59ed9b3a07829a60ba9
Author: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>
Date:   Fri Jan 30 10:45:33 2015 +0100

    ARM: pxa: make more mach/*.h files local
    
    Lots of header files are never included outside of a mach-pxa
    directory and do not need to be made visible in include/mach,
    so let's just move them all down one level.
