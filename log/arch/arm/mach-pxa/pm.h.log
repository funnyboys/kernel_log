commit a9a54caed96561d01f1d923df61bd11b71df4b93
Author: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>

    ARM: pxa: move extern declarations to pm.h
    
    When CONFIG_IWMMXT is disabled, we get a warning in pxa3xx.c:
    
    arch/arm/mach-pxa/pxa3xx.c: In function 'pxa3xx_cpu_pm_suspend':
    arch/arm/mach-pxa/pxa3xx.c:109:2: error: ISO C90 forbids mixed declarations and code [-Werror=declaration-after-statement]
    
    It turns out that there is an 'extern' declaration in the
    middle of a function.
    
    For consistency, this moves the declaration and two others from
    the same file into pm.h.

    ARM: pxa: make more mach/*.h files local
    
    Lots of header files are never included outside of a mach-pxa
    directory and do not need to be made visible in include/mach,
    so let's just move them all down one level.
