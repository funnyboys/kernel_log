    Update MIPS email addresses
    
    MIPS will soon not be a part of Imagination Technologies, and as such
    many @imgtec.com email addresses will no longer be valid. This patch
    updates the addresses for those who:
    
     - Have 10 or more patches in mainline authored using an @imgtec.com
       email address, or any patches dated within the past year.
    
     - Are still with Imagination but leaving as part of the MIPS business
       unit, as determined from an internal email address list.
    
     - Haven't already updated their email address (ie. JamesH) or expressed
       a desire to be excluded (ie. Maciej).
    
     - Acked v2 or earlier of this patch, which leaves Deng-Cheng, Matt &
       myself.
    
    New addresses are of the form firstname.lastname@mips.com, and all
    verified against an internal email address list.  An entry is added to
    .mailmap for each person such that get_maintainer.pl will report the new
    addresses rather than @imgtec.com addresses which will soon be dead.
    
    Instances of the affected addresses throughout the tree are then
    mechanically replaced with the new @mips.com address.

commit eed0eabd12ef061821cbfa20d903476e07645320
Author: Paul Burton <paul.burton@imgtec.com>

    MIPS: generic: Introduce generic DT-based board support
    
    Introduce a "generic" platform, which aims to be board-agnostic by
    making use of device trees passed by the boot protocol defined in the
    MIPS UHI (Universal Hosting Interface) specification. Provision is made
    for supporting boards which use a legacy boot protocol that can't be
    changed, but adding support for such boards or any others is left to
    followon patches.
    
    Right now the built kernels expect to be loaded to 0x80100000, ie. in
    kseg0. This is fine for the vast majority of MIPS platforms, but
    nevertheless it would be good to remove this limitation in the future by
    mapping the kernel via the TLB such that it can be loaded anywhere & map
    itself appropriately.
    
    Configuration is handled by dynamically generating configs using
    scripts/kconfig/merge_config.sh, somewhat similar to the way powerpc
    makes use of it. This allows for variations upon the configuration, eg.
    differing architecture revisions or subsets of driver support for
    differing boards, to be handled without having a large number of
    defconfig files.
