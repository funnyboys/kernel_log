    MIPS: Whitespace cleanup.
    
    Having received another series of whitespace patches I decided to do this
    once and for all rather than dealing with this kind of patches trickling
    in forever.

    mips: fix implicit smp.h usage in various files.
    
    We need to call out inclusion of smp.h, or with the module.h cleanup
    we'll get things like:
    
    arch/mips/loongson/common/platform.c:21: error: implicit declaration of function 'smp_processor_id'
    
    arch/mips/vr41xx/common/giu.c:84: error: implicit declaration of function 'smp_processor_id'

    [MIPS] Allow hardwiring of the CPU type to a single type for optimization.
    
    This saves a few k on systems which only ever ship with a single CPU type.
