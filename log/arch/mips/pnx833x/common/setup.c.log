    MIPS: make PCI_DMA_BUS_IS_PHYS=1 constant
    
    No one of supported MIPS machines has an IOMMU unit, so we can safely define
    PCI_DMA_BUS_IS_PHYS = 1. Also remove iommu flag from the pci controller
    structure, since it is useless.

    MIPS: Whitespace cleanup.
    
    Having received another series of whitespace patches I decided to do this
    once and for all rather than dealing with this kind of patches trickling
    in forever.

    MIPS: PNX833x: Move code one directory level up.
    
    It was sharing the nxp directory but no code with pnx8550 and will fit
    better into the new platform makefile scheme, if moved.
