    MIPS: Eleminate filenames from comments
    
    They tend to get not updated when files are moved around or copied and
    lack any obvious use.  While at it zap some only too obvious comments and
    as per Shinya's suggestion, add a copyright header to extable.c.

    i2c-sibyte: SWARM I2C board initialization
    
     The standard rtc-m41t80.c driver cannot be used with the SWARM as it is,
    because the board does not provide setup information for the I2C core.
    As a result the bus and the address to probe for the M41T80 chip is not
    known.
    
     Here is a set of changes that fix the problem:
    
    1. swarm-i2c.c -- SWARM I2C board setup, currently for the M41T80 chip on
       the bus #1 only (there is a MAX6654 temperature sensor on the bus #0
       which may be added in the future if we have a driver for that chip).
    
    2. The i2c-sibyte.c BCM1250A SMBus controller driver now registers its
       buses as numbered so that board setup is correctly applied.
