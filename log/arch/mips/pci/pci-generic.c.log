commit fb615d61b5583db92e3793709b97e35dc9499c2a
Author: Paul Burton <paul.burton@mips.com>

    Update MIPS email addresses
    
    MIPS will soon not be a part of Imagination Technologies, and as such
    many @imgtec.com email addresses will no longer be valid. This patch
    updates the addresses for those who:
    
     - Have 10 or more patches in mainline authored using an @imgtec.com
       email address, or any patches dated within the past year.
    
     - Are still with Imagination but leaving as part of the MIPS business
       unit, as determined from an internal email address list.
    
     - Haven't already updated their email address (ie. JamesH) or expressed
       a desire to be excluded (ie. Maciej).
    
     - Acked v2 or earlier of this patch, which leaves Deng-Cheng, Matt &
       myself.
    
    New addresses are of the form firstname.lastname@mips.com, and all
    verified against an internal email address list.  An entry is added to
    .mailmap for each person such that get_maintainer.pl will report the new
    addresses rather than @imgtec.com addresses which will soon be dead.
    
    Instances of the affected addresses throughout the tree are then
    mechanically replaced with the new @mips.com address.

commit 87dd9a4de421f052fd9be58c7da08a453f340d5e

    MIPS: PCI: Support generic drivers
    
    Introduce support for PCI drivers using only functionality provided
    generically by the PCI subsystem, by adding the minimum arch-provided
    functions required.
    
    The driver this has been developed for & tested with the xilinx-pcie on
    a MIPS Boston development board.
