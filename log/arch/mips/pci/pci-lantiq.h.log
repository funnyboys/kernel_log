commit e47d488935ed0b2dd3d59d3ba4e13956ff6849c0

    MIPS: Lantiq: Add PCI controller support.
    
    The Lantiq family of SoCs have a EBU (External Bus Unit). This patch adds
    the driver that allows us to use the EBU as a PCI controller. In order for
    PCI to work the EBU is set to endianess swap all the data. In addition we
    need to make use of SWAP_IO_SPACE for device->host DMA to work.
    
    The clock of the PCI works in several modes (internal/external). If this
    is not configured correctly the SoC will hang.
