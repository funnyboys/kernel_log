    y2038: ipc: remove __kernel_time_t reference from headers
    
    There are two structures based on time_t that conflict between libc and
    kernel: timeval and timespec. Both are now renamed to __kernel_old_timeval
    and __kernel_old_timespec.
    
    For time_t, the old typedef is still __kernel_time_t. There is nothing
    wrong with that name, but it would be nice to not use that going forward
    as this type is used almost only in deprecated interfaces because of
    the y2038 overflow.
    
    In the IPC headers (msgbuf.h, sembuf.h, shmbuf.h), __kernel_time_t is only
    used for the 64-bit variants, which are not deprecated.
    
    Change these to a plain 'long', which is the same type as __kernel_time_t
    on all 64-bit architectures anyway, to reduce the number of users of the
    old type.

    y2038: mips: Extend sysvipc data structures
    
    MIPS is the weirdest case for sysvipc, because each of the
    three data structures is done differently:
    
    * msqid64_ds has padding in the right place so we could in theory
      extend this one to just have 64-bit values instead of time_t.
      As this does not work for most of the other combinations,
      we just handle it in the common manner though.
    
    * semid64_ds has no padding for 64-bit time_t, but has two reserved
      'long' fields, which are sufficient to extend the sem_otime
      and sem_ctime fields to 64 bit. In order to do this, the libc
      implementation will have to copy the data into another structure
      that has the fields in a different order. MIPS is the only
      architecture with this problem, so this is best done in MIPS
      specific libc code.
    
    * shmid64_ds is slightly worse than that, because it has three
      time_t fields but only two unused 32-bit words. As a workaround,
      we extend each field only by 16 bits, ending up with 48-bit
      timestamps that user space again has to work around by itself.
    
    The compat versions of the data structures are changed in the
    same way.

    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with no license
    
    Many user space API headers are missing licensing information, which
    makes it hard for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default are files without license information under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPLV2.  Marking them GPLV2 would exclude
    them from being included in non GPLV2 code, which is obviously not
    intended. The user space API headers fall under the syscall exception
    which is in the kernels COPYING file:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    otherwise syscall usage would not be possible.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with an SPDX
    license identifier.  The chosen identifier is 'GPL-2.0 WITH
    Linux-syscall-note' which is the officially assigned identifier for the
    Linux syscall exception.  SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.
