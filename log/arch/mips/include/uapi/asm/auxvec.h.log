    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with a license
    
    Many user space API headers have licensing information, which is either
    incomplete, badly formatted or just a shorthand for referring to the
    license under which the file is supposed to be.  This makes it hard for
    compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    Update these files with an SPDX license identifier.  The identifier was
    chosen based on the license information in the file.
    
    GPL/LGPL licensed headers get the matching GPL/LGPL SPDX license
    identifier with the added 'WITH Linux-syscall-note' exception, which is
    the officially assigned exception identifier for the kernel syscall
    exception:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    This exception makes it possible to include GPL headers into non GPL
    code, without confusing license compliance tools.
    
    Headers which have either explicit dual licensing or are just licensed
    under a non GPL license are updated with the corresponding SPDX
    identifier and the GPLv2 with syscall exception identifier.  The format
    is:
            ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR SPDX-ID-OF-OTHER-LICENSE)
    
    SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding shorthand, which can be
    used instead of the full boiler plate text.  The update does not remove
    existing license information as this has to be done on a case by case
    basis and the copyright holders might have to be consulted. This will
    happen in a separate step.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.

    MIPS: Define AT_VECTOR_SIZE_ARCH for ARCH_DLINFO
    
    AT_VECTOR_SIZE_ARCH should be defined with the maximum number of
    NEW_AUX_ENT entries that ARCH_DLINFO can contain, but it wasn't defined
    for MIPS at all even though ARCH_DLINFO will contain one NEW_AUX_ENT for
    the VDSO address.
    
    This shouldn't be a problem as AT_VECTOR_SIZE_BASE includes space for
    AT_BASE_PLATFORM which MIPS doesn't use, but lets define it now and add
    the comment above ARCH_DLINFO as found in several other architectures to
    remind future modifiers of ARCH_DLINFO to keep AT_VECTOR_SIZE_ARCH up to
    date.

    MIPS: Initial implementation of a VDSO
    
    Add an initial implementation of a proper (i.e. an ELF shared library)
    VDSO. With this commit it does not export any symbols, it only replaces
    the current signal return trampoline page. A later commit will add user
    implementations of gettimeofday()/clock_gettime().
    
    To support both new toolchains and old ones which don't generate ABI
    flags section, we define its content manually and then use a tool
    (genvdso) to patch up the section to have the correct name and type.
    genvdso also extracts symbol offsets ({,rt_}sigreturn) needed by the
    kernel, and generates a C file containing a "struct mips_vdso_image"
    containing both the VDSO data and these offsets. This C file is
    compiled into the kernel.
    
    On 64-bit kernels we require a different VDSO for each supported ABI,
    so we may build up to 3 different VDSOs. The VDSO to use is selected by
    the mips_abi structure.
    
    A kernel/user shared data page is created and mapped below the VDSO
    image. This is currently empty, but will be used by the user time
    function implementations which are added later.
    
    [markos.chandras@imgtec.com:
    - Add more comments
    - Move abi detection in genvdso.h since it's the get_symbol function
    that needs it.
    - Add an R6 specific way to calculate the base address of VDSO in order
    to avoid the branch instruction which affects performance.
    - Do not patch .gnu.attributes since it's not needed for dynamic linking.
    - Simplify Makefile a little bit.
    - checkpatch fixes
    - Restrict VDSO support for binutils < 2.25 for pre-R6
    - Include atomic64.h for O32 variant on MIPS64]

    MIPS: use generic-y where possible
    
    Use generic-y and remove headers in arch/mips/include/[uapi/]asm/Kbuild
    where the header just includes or is identical to the corresponding
    <asm-generic/*.h>.
    
    We can't do the same for uapi/asm/kvm_para.h because it's presence is
    explicitly checked in include/uapi/linux/Kbuild to decide whether to add
    kvm_para.h to header-y.
