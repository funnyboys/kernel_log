    MIPS: Introduce isa-rev.h to define MIPS_ISA_REV
    
    There are multiple instances in the kernel where we need to include or
    exclude particular instructions based on the ISA revision of the target
    processor. For MIPS32 / MIPS64, the compiler exports a __mips_isa_rev
    define. However, when targeting MIPS I - V, this define is absent. This
    leads to each use of __mips_isa_rev having to check that it is defined
    first. To simplify this, introduce the isa-rev.h header which always
    exports MIPS_ISA_REV. The name is changed so as to avoid confusion with
    the compiler builtin and to avoid accidentally using the builtin.
    MIPS_ISA_REV is defined to the compilers builtin if provided, or 0,
    which satisfies all current usages.
