    MIPS, Perf-events: Work with irq_work
    
    This is the MIPS part of the following commit by Peter Zijlstra:
    
    - e360adbe29241a0194e10e20595360dd7b98a2b3
        irq_work: Add generic hardirq context callbacks
    
        Provide a mechanism that allows running code in IRQ context. It is
        most useful for NMI code that needs to interact with the rest of the
        system -- like wakeup a task to drain buffers.
    
        Perf currently has such a mechanism, so extract that and provide it as
        a generic feature, independent of perf so that others may also
        benefit.
    
        The IRQ context callback is generated through self-IPIs where
        possible, or on architectures like powerpc the decrementer (the
        built-in timer facility) is set to generate an interrupt immediately.
    
        Architectures that don't have anything like this get to do with a
        callback from the timer tick. These architectures can call
        irq_work_run() at the tail of any IRQ handlers that might enqueue such
        work (like the perf IRQ handler) to avoid undue latencies in
        processing the work.
    
    For MIPSXX, we need to call irq_work_run() at the tail of the perf IRQ
    handler as described above.

    MIPS: add support for hardware performance events (skeleton)
    
    This patch provides the skeleton of the HW perf event support. To enable
    this feature, we can not choose the SMTC kernel; Oprofile should be
    disabled; kernel performance events be selected. Then we can enable it in
    Kernel type menu.
    
    Oprofile for MIPS platforms initializes irq at arch init time. Currently
    we do not change this logic to allow PMU reservation.
    
    If a platform has EIC, we can use the irq base and perf counter irq offset
    defines for the interrupt controller in specific init_hw_perf_events().
    
    Based on this skeleton patch, the 3 different kinds of MIPS PMU, namely,
    mipsxx/loongson2/rm9000, can be supported by adding corresponding lower
    level C files at the bottom. The suggested names of these files are
    perf_event_mipsxx.c/perf_event_loongson2.c/perf_event_rm9000.c. So, for
    example, we can do this by adding "#include perf_event_mipsxx.c" at the
    bottom of perf_event.c.
    
    In addition, PMUs with 64bit counters are also considered in this patch.
