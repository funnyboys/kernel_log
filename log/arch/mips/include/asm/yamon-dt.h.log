    Update MIPS email addresses
    
    MIPS will soon not be a part of Imagination Technologies, and as such
    many @imgtec.com email addresses will no longer be valid. This patch
    updates the addresses for those who:
    
     - Have 10 or more patches in mainline authored using an @imgtec.com
       email address, or any patches dated within the past year.
    
     - Are still with Imagination but leaving as part of the MIPS business
       unit, as determined from an internal email address list.
    
     - Haven't already updated their email address (ie. JamesH) or expressed
       a desire to be excluded (ie. Maciej).
    
     - Acked v2 or earlier of this patch, which leaves Deng-Cheng, Matt &
       myself.
    
    New addresses are of the form firstname.lastname@mips.com, and all
    verified against an internal email address list.  An entry is added to
    .mailmap for each person such that get_maintainer.pl will report the new
    addresses rather than @imgtec.com addresses which will soon be dead.
    
    Instances of the affected addresses throughout the tree are then
    mechanically replaced with the new @mips.com address.

    MIPS: generic/yamon-dt: Support > 256MB of RAM
    
    YAMON can expose more than 256MB of RAM to Linux on Malta by passing an
    ememsize environment variable with the full size, but the kernel then
    needs to be careful to choose the corresponding physical memory regions,
    avoiding the IO memory window. This is platform dependent, and on Malta
    it also depends on the memory layout which varies between system
    controllers.
    
    Extend yamon_dt_amend_memory() to generically handle this by taking
    [e]memsize bytes of memory from an array of memory regions passed in as
    a new parameter. Board code provides this array as appropriate depending
    on its own memory map.
    
    [paul.burton@imgtec.com: SEAD-3 supports 384MB DDR from 0]

    In preparation for supporting other YAMON-using boards (Malta) & sharing
    code to translate information from YAMON into device tree properties,
    pull the code doing so for the kernel command line, system memory &
    serial configuration out of the SEAD-3 board code.
