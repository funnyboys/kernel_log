commit 05510f2b4819398a25ef432d72efa9e95419768a
Author: Marcin Nowakowski <marcin.nowakowski@imgtec.com>
Date:   Tue Mar 7 14:19:56 2017 +0100

    MIPS: Enable GENERIC_CPU_AUTOPROBE
    
    Add missing macros and methods that are required by
    CONFIG_GENERIC_CPU_AUTOPROBE: MAX_CPU_FEATURES, cpu_have_feature(),
    cpu_feature().
    
    Also set a default elf platform as currently it is not set for most MIPS
    platforms resulting in incorrectly specified modalias values in cpu
    autoprobe ("cpu:type:(null):feature:...").
    
    Export 'elf_hwcap' symbol so that it can be accessed from modules that
    use module_cpu_feature_match()
