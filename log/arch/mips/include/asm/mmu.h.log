    MIPS: MemoryMapID (MMID) Support
    
    Introduce support for using MemoryMapIDs (MMIDs) as an alternative to
    Address Space IDs (ASIDs). The major difference between the two is that
    MMIDs are global - ie. an MMID uniquely identifies an address space
    across all coherent CPUs. In contrast ASIDs are non-global per-CPU IDs,
    wherein each address space is allocated a separate ASID for each CPU
    upon which it is used. This global namespace allows a new GINVT
    instruction be used to globally invalidate TLB entries associated with a
    particular MMID across all coherent CPUs in the system, removing the
    need for IPIs to invalidate entries with separate ASIDs on each CPU.
    
    The allocation scheme used here is largely borrowed from arm64 (see
    arch/arm64/mm/context.c). In essence we maintain a bitmap to track
    available MMIDs, and MMIDs in active use at the time of a rollover to a
    new MMID version are preserved in the new version. The allocation scheme
    requires efficient 64 bit atomics in order to perform reasonably, so
    this support depends upon CONFIG_GENERIC_ATOMIC64=n (ie. currently it
    will only be included in MIPS64 kernels).
    
    The first, and currently only, available CPU with support for MMIDs is
    the MIPS I6500. This CPU supports 16 bit MMIDs, and so for now we cap
    our MMIDs to 16 bits wide in order to prevent the bitmap growing to
    absurd sizes if any future CPU does implement 32 bit MMIDs as the
    architecture manuals suggest is recommended.
    
    When MMIDs are in use we also make use of GINVT instruction which is
    available due to the global nature of MMIDs. By executing a sequence of
    GINVT & SYNC 0x14 instructions we can avoid the overhead of an IPI to
    each remote CPU in many cases. One complication is that GINVT will
    invalidate wired entries (in all cases apart from type 0, which targets
    the entire TLB). In order to avoid GINVT invalidating any wired TLB
    entries we set up, we make sure to create those entries using a reserved
    MMID (0) that we never associate with any address space.
    
    Also of note is that KVM will require further work in order to support
    MMIDs & GINVT, since KVM is involved in allocating IDs for guests & in
    configuring the MMU. That work is not part of this patch, so for now
    when MMIDs are in use KVM is disabled.

    MIPS: Remove struct mm_context_t fp_mode_switching field
    
    The fp_mode_switching field in struct mm_context_t was left unused by
    commit 8c8d953c2800 ("MIPS: Schedule on CPUs we need to lose FPU for a
    mode switch") in v4.19, with nothing modifying its value & nothing
    waiting on it having any particular value after that commit. Remove the
    unused field & the one remaining reference to it.

    MIPS: Expand MIPS32 ASIDs to 64 bits
    
    ASIDs have always been stored as unsigned longs, ie. 32 bits on MIPS32
    kernels. This is problematic because it is feasible for the ASID version
    to overflow & wrap around to zero.
    
    We currently attempt to handle this overflow by simply setting the ASID
    version to 1, using asid_first_version(), but we make no attempt to
    account for the fact that there may be mm_structs with stale ASIDs that
    have versions which we now reuse due to the overflow & wrap around.
    
    Encountering this requires that:
    
      1) A struct mm_struct X is active on CPU A using ASID (V,n).
    
      2) That mm is not used on CPU A for the length of time that it takes
         for CPU A's asid_cache to overflow & wrap around to the same
         version V that the mm had in step 1. During this time tasks using
         the mm could either be sleeping or only scheduled on other CPUs.
    
      3) Some other mm Y becomes active on CPU A and is allocated the same
         ASID (V,n).
    
      4) mm X now becomes active on CPU A again, and now incorrectly has the
         same ASID as mm Y.
    
    Where struct mm_struct ASIDs are represented above in the format
    (version, EntryHi.ASID), and on a typical MIPS32 system version will be
    24 bits wide & EntryHi.ASID will be 8 bits wide.
    
    The length of time required in step 2 is highly dependent upon the CPU &
    workload, but for a hypothetical 2GHz CPU running a workload which
    generates a new ASID every 10000 cycles this period is around 248 days.
    Due to this long period of time & the fact that tasks need to be
    scheduled in just the right (or wrong, depending upon your inclination)
    way, this is obviously a difficult bug to encounter but it's entirely
    possible as evidenced by reports.
    
    In order to fix this, simply extend ASIDs to 64 bits even on MIPS32
    builds. This will extend the period of time required for the
    hypothetical system above to encounter the problem from 28 days to
    around 3 trillion years, which feels safely outside of the realms of
    possibility.
    
    The cost of this is slightly more generated code in some commonly
    executed paths, but this is pretty minimal:
    
                             | Code Size Gain | Percentage
      -----------------------|----------------|-------------
        decstation_defconfig |           +270 | +0.00%
            32r2el_defconfig |           +652 | +0.01%
            32r6el_defconfig |          +1000 | +0.01%
    
    I have been unable to measure any change in performance of the LMbench
    lat_ctx or lat_proc tests resulting from the 64b ASIDs on either
    32r2el_defconfig+interAptiv or 32r6el_defconfig+I6500 systems.

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    MIPS: Use per-mm page to execute branch delay slot instructions
    
    In some cases the kernel needs to execute an instruction from the delay
    slot of an emulated branch instruction. These cases include:
    
      - Emulated floating point branch instructions (bc1[ft]l?) for systems
        which don't include an FPU, or upon which the kernel is run with the
        "nofpu" parameter.
    
      - MIPSr6 systems running binaries targeting older revisions of the
        architecture, which may include branch instructions whose encodings
        are no longer valid in MIPSr6.
    
    Executing instructions from such delay slots is done by writing the
    instruction to memory followed by a trap, as part of an "emuframe", and
    executing it. This avoids the requirement of an emulator for the entire
    MIPS instruction set. Prior to this patch such emuframes are written to
    the user stack and executed from there.
    
    This patch moves FP branch delay emuframes off of the user stack and
    into a per-mm page. Allocating a page per-mm leaves userland with access
    to only what it had access to previously, and compared to other
    solutions is relatively simple.
    
    When a thread requires a delay slot emulation, it is allocated a frame.
    A thread may only have one frame allocated at any one time, since it may
    only ever be executing one instruction at any one time. In order to
    ensure that we can free up allocated frame later, its index is recorded
    in struct thread_struct. In the typical case, after executing the delay
    slot instruction we'll execute a break instruction with the BRK_MEMU
    code. This traps back to the kernel & leads to a call to do_dsemulret
    which frees the allocated frame & moves the user PC back to the
    instruction that would have executed following the emulated branch.
    In some cases the delay slot instruction may be invalid, such as a
    branch, or may trigger an exception. In these cases the BRK_MEMU break
    instruction will not be hit. In order to ensure that frames are freed
    this patch introduces dsemul_thread_cleanup() and calls it to free any
    allocated frame upon thread exit. If the instruction generated an
    exception & leads to a signal being delivered to the thread, or indeed
    if a signal simply happens to be delivered to the thread whilst it is
    executing from the struct emuframe, then we need to take care to exit
    the frame appropriately. This is done by either rolling back the user PC
    to the branch or advancing it to the continuation PC prior to signal
    delivery, using dsemul_thread_rollback(). If this were not done then a
    sigreturn would return to the struct emuframe, and if that frame had
    meanwhile been used in response to an emulated branch instruction within
    the signal handler then we would execute the wrong user code.
    
    Whilst a user could theoretically place something like a compact branch
    to self in a delay slot and cause their thread to become stuck in an
    infinite loop with the frame never being deallocated, this would:
    
      - Only affect the users single process.
    
      - Be architecturally invalid since there would be a branch in the
        delay slot, which is forbidden.
    
      - Be extremely unlikely to happen by mistake, and provide a program
        with no more ability to harm the system than a simple infinite loop
        would.
    
    If a thread requires a delay slot emulation & no frame is available to
    it (ie. the process has enough other threads that all frames are
    currently in use) then the thread joins a waitqueue. It will sleep until
    a frame is freed by another thread in the process.
    
    Since we now know whether a thread has an allocated frame due to our
    tracking of its index, the cookie field of struct emuframe is removed as
    we can be more certain whether we have a valid frame. Since a thread may
    only ever have a single frame at any given time, the epc field of struct
    emuframe is also removed & the PC to continue from is instead stored in
    struct thread_struct. Together these changes simplify & shrink struct
    emuframe somewhat, allowing twice as many frames to fit into the page
    allocated for them.
    
    The primary benefit of this patch is that we are now free to mark the
    user stack non-executable where that is possible.

    MIPS,prctl: add PR_[GS]ET_FP_MODE prctl options for MIPS
    
    Userland code may be built using an ABI which permits linking to objects
    that have more restrictive floating point requirements. For example,
    userland code may be built to target the O32 FPXX ABI. Such code may be
    linked with other FPXX code, or code built for either one of the more
    restrictive FP32 or FP64. When linking with more restrictive code, the
    overall requirement of the process becomes that of the more restrictive
    code. The kernel has no way to know in advance which mode the process
    will need to be executed in, and indeed it may need to change during
    execution. The dynamic loader is the only code which will know the
    overall required mode, and so it needs to have a means to instruct the
    kernel to switch the FP mode of the process.
    
    This patch introduces 2 new options to the prctl syscall which provide
    such a capability. The FP mode of the process is represented as a
    simple bitmask combining a number of mode bits mirroring those present
    in the hardware. Userland can either retrieve the current FP mode of
    the process:
    
      mode = prctl(PR_GET_FP_MODE);
    
    or modify the current FP mode of the process:
    
      err = prctl(PR_SET_FP_MODE, new_mode);

    MIPS: Preliminary VDSO
    
    This is a preliminary patch to add a vdso to all user processes.  Still
    missing are ELF headers and .eh_frame information.  But it is enough to
    allow us to move signal trampolines off of the stack.  Note that emulation
    of branch delay slots in the FPU emulator still requires the stack.
    
    We allocate a single page (the vdso) and write all possible signal
    trampolines into it.  The stack is moved down by one page and the vdso is
    mapped into this space.
