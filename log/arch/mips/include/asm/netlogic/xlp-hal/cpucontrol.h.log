    MIPS: Netlogic: Handle XLP hardware errata
    
    Core configuration register IFU_BRUB_RESERVE has to be setup to handle
    a silicon errata which can result in a CPU hang.

    MIPS: Netlogic: Split XLP L1 i-cache among threads
    
    Since we now use r4k cache code for Netlogic XLP, it is
    better to split L1 icache among the active threads, so that
    threads won't step on each other while flushing icache.
    
    The L1 dcache is already split among the threads in the core.

    MIPS: Netlogic: SMP wakeup code update
    
    Update for core intialization code.  Initialize status register
    after receiving NMI for CPU wakeup. Add the low level L1D flush
    code before enabling threads in core.
    
    Also convert the ehb to _ehb so that it works under more GCC
    versions.

    MIPS: Netlogic: Add XLP platform files for XLP SoC
    
    - Update common files to support XLP.
    - Add arch/mips/include/asm/netlogic/xlp-hal for register definitions
      and access macros
    - Add arch/mips/netlogic/xlp/ for XLP specific files.
