    MIPS: Add header files reference with path prefix
    
    There are some common header files which are referenced locally
    with #includenext method, includenext is tricky method and only
    used on mips platform.
    
    This patech removes includenext method, replace it with defailed
    pathname prefix for header files.
    
    This patch passes to compile on all mips platform with defconfig,
    and is verified on my loongson64 box.
    
    Changes:
    --------
    v2:
      - Fix compiling issue on malta platform

    MIPS: Add support for PIC32MZDA platform
    
    This adds support for the Microchip PIC32 MIPS microcontroller with the
    specific variant PIC32MZDA. PIC32MZDA is based on the MIPS m14KEc core
    and boots using device tree.
    
    This includes an early pin setup and early clock setup needed prior to
    device tree being initialized. In additon, an interface is provided to
    synchronize access to registers shared across several peripherals.
