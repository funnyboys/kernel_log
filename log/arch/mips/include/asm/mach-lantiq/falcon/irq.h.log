    MIPS: Add header files reference with path prefix
    
    There are some common header files which are referenced locally
    with #includenext method, includenext is tricky method and only
    used on mips platform.
    
    This patech removes includenext method, replace it with defailed
    pathname prefix for header files.
    
    This patch passes to compile on all mips platform with defconfig,
    and is verified on my loongson64 box.
    
    Changes:
    --------
    v2:
      - Fix compiling issue on malta platform
