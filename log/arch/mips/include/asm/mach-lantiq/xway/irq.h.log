    MIPS: Add header files reference with path prefix
    
    There are some common header files which are referenced locally
    with #includenext method, includenext is tricky method and only
    used on mips platform.
    
    This patech removes includenext method, replace it with defailed
    pathname prefix for header files.
    
    This patch passes to compile on all mips platform with defconfig,
    and is verified on my loongson64 box.
    
    Changes:
    --------
    v2:
      - Fix compiling issue on malta platform

commit 8ec6d93508f705dacafd5fcd058c69ef405002f9
Author: John Crispin <blogic@openwrt.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 30 09:27:48 2011 +0200

    MIPS: Lantiq: add SoC specific code for XWAY family
    
    Add support for the Lantiq XWAY family of Mips24KEc SoCs.
    
    * Danube (PSB50702)
    * Twinpass (PSB4000)
    * AR9 (PSB50802)
    * Amazon SE (PSB5061)
    
    The Amazon SE is a lightweight SoC and has no PCI as well as a different
    clock. We split the code out into seperate files to handle this.
    
    The GPIO pins on the SoCs are multi function and there are several bits
    we can use to configure the pins. To be as compatible as possible to
    GPIOLIB we add a function
    
    int lq_gpio_request(unsigned int pin, unsigned int alt0,
            unsigned int alt1, unsigned int dir, const char *name);
    
    which lets you configure the 2 "alternate function" bits. This way drivers like
    PCI can make use of GPIOLIB without a cubersome wrapper.
    
    The PLL code inside arch/mips/lantiq/xway/clk-xway.c is voodoo to me. It was
    taken from a 2.4.20 source tree and was never really changed by me since then.
