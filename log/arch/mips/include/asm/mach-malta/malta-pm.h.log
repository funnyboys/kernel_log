    Update MIPS email addresses
    
    MIPS will soon not be a part of Imagination Technologies, and as such
    many @imgtec.com email addresses will no longer be valid. This patch
    updates the addresses for those who:
    
     - Have 10 or more patches in mainline authored using an @imgtec.com
       email address, or any patches dated within the past year.
    
     - Are still with Imagination but leaving as part of the MIPS business
       unit, as determined from an internal email address list.
    
     - Haven't already updated their email address (ie. JamesH) or expressed
       a desire to be excluded (ie. Maciej).
    
     - Acked v2 or earlier of this patch, which leaves Deng-Cheng, Matt &
       myself.
    
    New addresses are of the form firstname.lastname@mips.com, and all
    verified against an internal email address list.  An entry is added to
    .mailmap for each person such that get_maintainer.pl will report the new
    addresses rather than @imgtec.com addresses which will soon be dead.
    
    Instances of the affected addresses throughout the tree are then
    mechanically replaced with the new @mips.com address.

    MIPS: Malta: add suspend state entry code
    
    This patch introduces code which will enter a suspend state via the
    PIIX4. This can only be done when PCI support is enabled since it
    requires access to PCI I/O space and the generation of a special cycle
    on the PCI bus. In cases where PCI is disabled the mips_pm_suspend
    function will simply always return an error.
