    Update MIPS email addresses
    
    MIPS will soon not be a part of Imagination Technologies, and as such
    many @imgtec.com email addresses will no longer be valid. This patch
    updates the addresses for those who:
    
     - Have 10 or more patches in mainline authored using an @imgtec.com
       email address, or any patches dated within the past year.
    
     - Are still with Imagination but leaving as part of the MIPS business
       unit, as determined from an internal email address list.
    
     - Haven't already updated their email address (ie. JamesH) or expressed
       a desire to be excluded (ie. Maciej).
    
     - Acked v2 or earlier of this patch, which leaves Deng-Cheng, Matt &
       myself.
    
    New addresses are of the form firstname.lastname@mips.com, and all
    verified against an internal email address list.  An entry is added to
    .mailmap for each person such that get_maintainer.pl will report the new
    addresses rather than @imgtec.com addresses which will soon be dead.
    
    Instances of the affected addresses throughout the tree are then
    mechanically replaced with the new @mips.com address.

    MIPS: Malta: Setup RAM regions via DT
    
    Move memory configuration to be performed via device tree for the Malta
    board. This moves more Malta specific code to malta-dtshim.c, leaving
    the rest of the mti-malta code a little more board-agnostic. This will
    be useful to share more code between boards, with the device tree
    providing the board specifics as intended.
    
    Since we can't rely upon Malta boards running a bootloader capable of
    handling devictrees & filling in the required information, a piece of
    shim code (malta_dt_shim) is added to consume the (e)memsize variables
    provided as part of the bootloader environment (or on the kernel command
    line) then generate the DT memory node using the provided values.
