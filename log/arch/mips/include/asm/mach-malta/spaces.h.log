    when operating in EVA mode.

+ * 0x00000000 - 0x0fffffff: 1st RAM region, 256MB
+ * 0x10000000 - 0x1bffffff: GIC and CPC Control Registers
+ * 0x1c000000 - 0x1fffffff: I/O And Flash
+ * 0x20000000 - 0x7fffffff: 2nd RAM region, 1.5GB

+ * The kernel is still located in 0x80000000(kseg0). However,
+ * the physical mask has been shifted to 0x80000000 which exploits the alias
+ * on the Malta board. As a result of which, we override the __pa_symbol
+ * to peform direct mapping from virtual to physical addresses. In other
+ * words, the 0x80000000 virtual address maps to 0x80000000 physical address
+ * which in turn aliases to 0x0. We do this in order to be able to use a flat
+ * 2GB of memory (0x80000000 - 0xffffffff) so we can avoid the I/O hole in
+ * 0x10000000 - 0x1fffffff.
+ * The last 64KB of physical memory are reserved for correct HIGHMEM
+ * macros arithmetics.
