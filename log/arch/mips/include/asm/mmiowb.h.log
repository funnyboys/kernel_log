    mips/mmiowb: Add unconditional mmiowb() to arch_spin_unlock()
    
    The mmiowb() macro is horribly difficult to use and drivers will continue
    to work most of the time if they omit a call when it is required.
    
    Rather than rely on driver authors getting this right, push mmiowb() into
    arch_spin_unlock() for mips. If this is deemed to be a performance issue,
    a subsequent optimisation could make use of ARCH_HAS_MMIOWB to elide
    the barrier in cases where no I/O writes were performed inside the
    critical section.
