commit d4a67d9dc8a5a80c4ec1814791af8c0252c158b8

    MIPS: Add initial support for the Atheros AR71XX/AR724X/AR931X SoCs
    
    This patch adds initial support for various Atheros SoCs based on the
    MIPS 24Kc core. The following models are supported at the moment:
    
      - AR7130
      - AR7141
      - AR7161
      - AR9130
      - AR9132
      - AR7240
      - AR7241
      - AR7242
    
    The current patch contains minimal support only, but the resulting
    kernel can boot into user-space with using of an initramfs image on
    various boards which are using these SoCs. Support for more built-in
    devices and individual boards will be implemented in further patches.
