    mips: add support for folded p4d page tables
    
    Implement primitives necessary for the 4th level folding, add walks of p4d
    level where appropriate, replace 5leve-fixup.h with pgtable-nop4d.h and
    drop usage of __ARCH_USE_5LEVEL_HACK.

    mm/hugetlb: add size parameter to huge_pte_offset()
    
    A poisoned or migrated hugepage is stored as a swap entry in the page
    tables.  On architectures that support hugepages consisting of
    contiguous page table entries (such as on arm64) this leads to ambiguity
    in determining the page table entry to return in huge_pte_offset() when
    a poisoned entry is encountered.
    
    Let's remove the ambiguity by adding a size parameter to convey
    additional information about the requested address.  Also fixup the
    definition/usage of huge_pte_offset() throughout the tree.

    mm/hugetlb: reduce arch dependent code about huge_pmd_unshare
    
    Currently we have many duplicates in definitions of huge_pmd_unshare.  In
    all architectures this function just returns 0 when
    CONFIG_ARCH_WANT_HUGE_PMD_SHARE is N.
    
    This patch puts the default implementation in mm/hugetlb.c and lets these
    architectures use the common code.

    mm/hugetlb: reduce arch dependent code around follow_huge_*
    
    Currently we have many duplicates in definitions around
    follow_huge_addr(), follow_huge_pmd(), and follow_huge_pud(), so this
    patch tries to remove the m.  The basic idea is to put the default
    implementation for these functions in mm/hugetlb.c as weak symbols
    (regardless of CONFIG_ARCH_WANT_GENERAL_HUGETL B), and to implement
    arch-specific code only when the arch needs it.
    
    For follow_huge_addr(), only powerpc and ia64 have their own
    implementation, and in all other architectures this function just returns
    ERR_PTR(-EINVAL).  So this patch sets returning ERR_PTR(-EINVAL) as
    default.
    
    As for follow_huge_(pmd|pud)(), if (pmd|pud)_huge() is implemented to
    always return 0 in your architecture (like in ia64 or sparc,) it's never
    called (the callsite is optimized away) no matter how implemented it is.
    So in such architectures, we don't need arch-specific implementation.
    
    In some architecture (like mips, s390 and tile,) their current
    arch-specific follow_huge_(pmd|pud)() are effectively identical with the
    common code, so this patch lets these architecture use the common code.
    
    One exception is metag, where pmd_huge() could return non-zero but it
    expects follow_huge_pmd() to always return NULL.  This means that we need
    arch-specific implementation which returns NULL.  This behavior looks
    strange to me (because non-zero pmd_huge() implies that the architecture
    supports PMD-based hugepage, so follow_huge_pmd() can/should return some
    relevant value,) but that's beyond this cleanup patch, so let's keep it.
    
    Justification of non-trivial changes:
    - in s390, follow_huge_pmd() checks !MACHINE_HAS_HPAGE at first, and this
      patch removes the check. This is OK because we can assume MACHINE_HAS_HPAGE
      is true when follow_huge_pmd() can be called (note that pmd_huge() has
      the same check and always returns 0 for !MACHINE_HAS_HPAGE.)
    - in s390 and mips, we use HPAGE_MASK instead of PMD_MASK as done in common
      code. This patch forces these archs use PMD_MASK, but it's OK because
      they are identical in both archs.
      In s390, both of HPAGE_SHIFT and PMD_SHIFT are 20.
      In mips, HPAGE_SHIFT is defined as (PAGE_SHIFT + PAGE_SHIFT - 3) and
      PMD_SHIFT is define as (PAGE_SHIFT + PAGE_SHIFT + PTE_ORDER - 3), but
      PTE_ORDER is always 0, so these are identical.

    hugetlb: restrict hugepage_migration_support() to x86_64
    
    Currently hugepage migration is available for all archs which support
    pmd-level hugepage, but testing is done only for x86_64 and there're
    bugs for other archs.  So to avoid breaking such archs, this patch
    limits the availability strictly to x86_64 until developers of other
    archs get interested in enabling this feature.
    
    Simply disabling hugepage migration on non-x86_64 archs is not enough to
    fix the reported problem where sys_move_pages() hits the BUG_ON() in
    follow_page(FOLL_GET), so let's fix this by checking if hugepage
    migration is supported in vma_migratable().

    mm: migrate: check movability of hugepage in unmap_and_move_huge_page()
    
    Currently hugepage migration works well only for pmd-based hugepages
    (mainly due to lack of testing,) so we had better not enable migration of
    other levels of hugepages until we are ready for it.
    
    Some users of hugepage migration (mbind, move_pages, and migrate_pages) do
    page table walk and check pud/pmd_huge() there, so they are safe.  But the
    other users (softoffline and memory hotremove) don't do this, so without
    this patch they can try to migrate unexpected types of hugepages.
    
    To prevent this, we introduce hugepage_migration_support() as an
    architecture dependent check of whether hugepage are implemented on a pmd
    basis or not.  And on some architecture multiple sizes of hugepages are
    available, so hugepage_migration_support() also checks hugepage size.

    include cleanup: Update gfp.h and slab.h includes to prepare for breaking implicit slab.h inclusion from percpu.h
    
    percpu.h is included by sched.h and module.h and thus ends up being
    included when building most .c files.  percpu.h includes slab.h which
    in turn includes gfp.h making everything defined by the two files
    universally available and complicating inclusion dependencies.
    
    percpu.h -> slab.h dependency is about to be removed.  Prepare for
    this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those
    headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion
    needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is
    used as the basis of conversion.
    
      http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py
    
    The script does the followings.
    
    * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that
      only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,
      gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.
    
    * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include
      blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms
      to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains
      core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -
      alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there
      doesn't seem to be any matching order.
    
    * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly
      because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out
      an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the
      file.
    
    The conversion was done in the following steps.
    
    1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly
       over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h
       and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400
       files.
    
    2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,
       some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or
       embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added
       inclusions to around 150 files.
    
    3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits
       from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.
    
    4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.
       e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab
       APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.
    
    5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically
       editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h
       files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h
       inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually
       wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each
       slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as
       necessary.
    
    6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.
    
    7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures
       were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my
       distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few
       more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things
       build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).
    
       * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.
       * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig
       * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig
       * ia64 SMP allmodconfig
       * s390 SMP allmodconfig
       * alpha SMP allmodconfig
       * um on x86_64 SMP allmodconfig
    
    8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as
       a separate patch and serve as bisection point.
    
    Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step
    6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch.
    If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch
    headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of
    the specific arch.

    MIPS: Nuke trailing blank lines
    
    Recent git versions now warn about those and they've always been a bit of
    an annoyance.

commit 405f55712dfe464b3240d7816cc4fe4174831be2
Author: Alexey Dobriyan <adobriyan@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Jul 11 22:08:37 2009 +0400

    headers: smp_lock.h redux
    
    * Remove smp_lock.h from files which don't need it (including some headers!)
    * Add smp_lock.h to files which do need it
    * Make smp_lock.h include conditional in hardirq.h
      It's needed only for one kernel_locked() usage which is under CONFIG_PREEMPT
    
      This will make hardirq.h inclusion cheaper for every PREEMPT=n config
      (which includes allmodconfig/allyesconfig, BTW)
