commit 5c93316c8c2276323af2d98e9676efda7d055bee
Author: Alexander Sverdlin <alexander.sverdlin@nokia.com>
Date:   Fri Jul 13 17:51:56 2018 +0200

    mips: unify prom_putchar() declarations
    
    prom_putchar() is used centrally in early printk infrastructure therefore
    at least MIPS should agree on the function return type.
    
    [paul.burton@mips.com:
      - Include linux/types.h in asm/setup.h to gain the bool typedef before
        we start include asm/setup.h elsewhere.
      - Include asm/setup.h in all files that use or define prom_putchar().
      - Also standardise on signed rather than unsigned char argument.]
