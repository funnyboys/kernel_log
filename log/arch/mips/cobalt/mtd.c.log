    MIPS: Cobalt Don't use module_init in non-modular MTD registration.
    
    As of commit 34b1252bd91851f77f89fbb6829a04efad900f41 ("MIPS:
    Cobalt: Do not build MTD platform device registration code as module.")
    this file became built-in instead of modular.  So we should also
    stop using module_init as an alias for __initcall as that can be
    rather misleading.
    
    Fix this up now, so that we can relocate module_init from
    init.h into module.h in the future.  If we don't do this, we'd
    have to add module.h to obviously non-modular code, and that
    would be a worse thing.
    
    Direct use of __initcall is discouraged, vs prioritized ones.
    Use of device_initcall is consistent with what __initcall
    maps onto, and hence does not change the init order, making the
    impact of this change zero.

    MIPS: Whitespace cleanup.
    
    Having received another series of whitespace patches I decided to do this
    once and for all rather than dealing with this kind of patches trickling
    in forever.
