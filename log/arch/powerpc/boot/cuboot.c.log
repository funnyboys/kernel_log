commit 85aecac8d2893372c618bac373e2de9cf102dfbc
Author: David Gibson <david@gibson.dropbear.id.au>
Date:   Wed Jun 13 14:53:00 2007 +1000

    [POWERPC] Consolidate cuboot initialization code
    
    The various cuboot platforms (i.e. pre-device tree aware u-boot for
    83xx, 85xx and Ebony) share a certain amount of code for parsing the
    boot parameters.  To a certain extent that's inevitable, since they
    platforms have different definitions of the bd_t structure.  However,
    with some macro work and a helper function, this patch improves the
    situation a bit.
    
    In the process, this fixes a bug on Ebony, which was incorrectly
    handling the parameters passed form u-boot for the command line (the
    bug was copied from 83xx and 85xx which have subsequently been fixed).
