commit f6dfc80554b27da11dbb36ebae166b23ec3aa9ca
Author: David Gibson <david@gibson.dropbear.id.au>
Date:   Tue May 8 14:10:01 2007 +1000

    [POWERPC] Support for the Ebony 440GP reference board in arch/powerpc
    
    This adds platform support code for the Ebony (440GP) evaluation
    board.  This includes both code in arch/powerpc/platforms/44x for
    board initialization, and zImage wrapper code to correctly tweak the
    flattened device tree based on information from the firmware.  The
    zImage supports both IBM OpenBIOS (aka "treeboot") and old versions of
    uboot which don't support a flattened device tree.
