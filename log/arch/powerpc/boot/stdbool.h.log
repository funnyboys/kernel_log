    powerpc/boot: Add support for XZ compression
    
    This patch adds an option to use XZ compression for the kernel image.
    
    Currently this is only enabled for 64-bit Book3S targets, which is
    roughly equivalent to the platforms that use the kernel's zImage
    wrapper, and that have been tested.
    
    The bulk of the 32-bit platforms and 64-bit BookE use uboot images,
    which relies on uboot implementing XZ. In future we can enable XZ
    support for those targets once someone has tested it.
