     "Highlights:
    
       - Infrastructure for secure boot on some bare metal Power9 machines.
         The firmware support is still in development, so the code here
         won't actually activate secure boot on any existing systems.
    
       - A change to xmon (our crash handler / pseudo-debugger) to restrict
         it to read-only mode when the kernel is lockdown'ed, otherwise it's
         trivial to drop into xmon and modify kernel data, such as the
         lockdown state.
    
       - Support for KASLR on 32-bit BookE machines (Freescale / NXP).
    
       - Fixes for our flush_icache_range() and __kernel_sync_dicache()
         (VDSO) to work with memory ranges >4GB.
    
       - Some reworks of the pseries CMM (Cooperative Memory Management)
         driver to make it behave more like other balloon drivers and enable
         some cleanups of generic mm code.
    
       - A series of fixes to our hardware breakpoint support to properly
         handle unaligned watchpoint addresses.
    
      Plus a bunch of other smaller improvements, fixes and cleanups.

    powerpc/book3s64: Fix link stack flush on context switch
    
    In commit ee13cb249fab ("powerpc/64s: Add support for software count
    cache flush"), I added support for software to flush the count
    cache (indirect branch cache) on context switch if firmware told us
    that was the required mitigation for Spectre v2.
    
    As part of that code we also added a software flush of the link
    stack (return address stack), which protects against Spectre-RSB
    between user processes.
    
    That is all correct for CPUs that activate that mitigation, which is
    currently Power9 Nimbus DD2.3.
    
    What I got wrong is that on older CPUs, where firmware has disabled
    the count cache, we also need to flush the link stack on context
    switch.
    
    To fix it we create a new feature bit which is not set by firmware,
    which tells us we need to flush the link stack. We set that when
    firmware tells us that either of the existing Spectre v2 mitigations
    are enabled.
    
    Then we adjust the patching code so that if we see that feature bit we
    enable the link stack flush. If we're also told to flush the count
    cache in software then we fall through and do that also.
    
    On the older CPUs we don't need to do do the software count cache
    flush, firmware has disabled it, so in that case we patch in an early
    return after the link stack flush.
    
    The naming of some of the functions is awkward after this patch,
    because they're called "count cache" but they also do link stack. But
    we'll fix that up in a later commit to ease backporting.
    
    This is the fix for CVE-2019-18660.

    powerpc/security: Fix debugfs data leak on 32-bit
    
    "powerpc_security_features" is "unsigned long", i.e. 32-bit or 64-bit,
    depending on the platform (PPC_FSL_BOOK3E or PPC_BOOK3S_64).  Hence
    casting its address to "u64 *", and calling debugfs_create_x64() is
    wrong, and leaks 32-bit of nearby data to userspace on 32-bit platforms.
    
    While all currently defined SEC_FTR_* security feature flags fit in
    32-bit, they all have "ULL" suffixes to make them 64-bit constants.
    Hence fix the leak by changing the type of "powerpc_security_features"
    (and the parameter types of its accessors) to "u64".  This also allows
    to drop the cast.

    powerpc/64s: Add support for software count cache flush
    
    Some CPU revisions support a mode where the count cache needs to be
    flushed by software on context switch. Additionally some revisions may
    have a hardware accelerated flush, in which case the software flush
    sequence can be shortened.
    
    If we detect the appropriate flag from firmware we patch a branch
    into _switch() which takes us to a count cache flush sequence.
    
    That sequence in turn may be patched to return early if we detect that
    the CPU supports accelerating the flush sequence in hardware.
    
    Add debugfs support for reporting the state of the flush, as well as
    runtime disabling it.
    
    And modify the spectre_v2 sysfs file to report the state of the
    software flush.

    powerpc/64s: Add support for a store forwarding barrier at kernel entry/exit
    
    On some CPUs we can prevent a vulnerability related to store-to-load
    forwarding by preventing store forwarding between privilege domains,
    by inserting a barrier in kernel entry and exit paths.
    
    This is known to be the case on at least Power7, Power8 and Power9
    powerpc CPUs.
    
    Barriers must be inserted generally before the first load after moving
    to a higher privilege, and after the last store before moving to a
    lower privilege, HV and PR privilege transitions must be protected.
    
    Barriers are added as patch sections, with all kernel/hypervisor entry
    points patched, and the exit points to lower privilge levels patched
    similarly to the RFI flush patching.
    
    Firmware advertisement is not implemented yet, so CPU flush types
    are hard coded.

    powerpc: Add security feature flags for Spectre/Meltdown
    
    This commit adds security feature flags to reflect the settings we
    receive from firmware regarding Spectre/Meltdown mitigations.
    
    The feature names reflect the names we are given by firmware on bare
    metal machines. See the hostboot source for details.
    
    Arguably these could be firmware features, but that then requires them
    to be read early in boot so they're available prior to asm feature
    patching, but we don't actually want to use them for patching. We may
    also want to dynamically update them in future, which would be
    incompatible with the way firmware features work (at the moment at
    least). So for now just make them separate flags.
