commit 6db92cc9d07db9f713da8554b4bcdfc8e54ad386
Author: Harninder Rai <harninder.rai@freescale.com>
Date:   Wed Oct 13 17:30:56 2010 +0530

    powerpc/85xx: add cache-sram support
    
    It adds cache-sram support in P1/P2 QorIQ platforms as under:
    
    * A small abstraction over powerpc's remote heap allocator
    * Exports mpc85xx_cache_sram_alloc()/free() APIs
    * Supports only one contiguous SRAM window
    * Drivers can do the following in Kconfig to use these APIs
        "select FSL_85XX_CACHE_SRAM if MPC85xx"
    * Required SRAM size and the offset where SRAM should be mapped must be
      provided at kernel command line as :
        cache-sram-size=<value>
        cache-sram-offset=<offset>
