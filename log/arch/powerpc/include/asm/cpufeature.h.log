commit 4a1202765ddf4e5bb3143c0a859ee37f8fcf9b85

    powerpc: Add module autoloading based on CPU features
    
    This patch provides the necessary infrastructure to allow drivers
    to be automatically loaded via udev. It implements the minimum
    required to be able to use module_cpu_feature_match() to trigger
    the GENERIC_CPU_AUTOPROBE mechanisms.
    
    The features exposed are a mirror of the cpu_user_features
    (converted to an offset from a mask). This decision was made to
    ensure that the behavior between features for module loading and
    userspace are consistent.
