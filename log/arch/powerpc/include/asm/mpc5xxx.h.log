commit 87c441e54dfcf9f45593ecaf68e7e18ea53d5e13
Author: Wolfgang Denk <wd@denx.de>
Date:   Wed Jun 17 00:30:22 2009 -0600

    powerpc/5xxx: Add common mpc5xxx_get_bus_frequency() function
    
    So far, MPC512x used mpc512x_find_ips_freq() to get the bus frequency,
    while MPC52xx used mpc52xx_find_ipb_freq().  Despite the different
    clock names (IPS vs. IPB) the code was identical.
    
    Use common code for both processor families.
