commit 197165d44925bd0fa892990851dee4d312a44b39
Author: Naveen N. Rao <naveen.n.rao@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

    powerpc/ftrace: add powerpc timebase as a trace clock source
    
    Add a new powerpc-specific trace clock using the timebase register,
    similar to x86-tsc. This gives us
    - a fast, monotonic, hardware clock source for trace entries, and
    - a clock that can be used to correlate events across cpus as well as across
      hypervisor and guests.
