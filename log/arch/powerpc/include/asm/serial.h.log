commit b8b572e1015f81b4e748417be2629dfe51ab99f9
Author: Stephen Rothwell <sfr@canb.auug.org.au>
Date:   Fri Aug 1 15:20:30 2008 +1000

    powerpc: Move include files to arch/powerpc/include/asm
    
    from include/asm-powerpc.  This is the result of a
    
    mkdir arch/powerpc/include/asm
    git mv include/asm-powerpc/* arch/powerpc/include/asm
    
    Followed by a few documentation/comment fixups and a couple of places
    where <asm-powepc/...> was being used explicitly.  Of the latter only
    one was outside the arch code and it is a driver only built for powerpc.
