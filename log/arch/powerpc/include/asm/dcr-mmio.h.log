commit ba52464a629fab2493925007b00f2ca65d02ed4e
Author: Grant Likely <grant.likely@linaro.org>
Date:   Fri May 23 07:50:50 2014 +0900

    of: Stop naming platform_device using dcr address
    
    There is now a way to ensure all platform devices get a unique name when
    populated from the device tree, and the DCR_NATIVE code path is broken
    anyway. PowerPC Cell (PS3) is the only platform that actually uses this
    path.  Most likely nobody will notice if it is killed. Remove the code
    and associated ugly #ifdef.
    
    The user-visible impact of this patch is that any DCR device on Cell
    will get a new name in the /sys/devices hierarchy.

commit b8b572e1015f81b4e748417be2629dfe51ab99f9
Author: Stephen Rothwell <sfr@canb.auug.org.au>
Date:   Fri Aug 1 15:20:30 2008 +1000

    powerpc: Move include files to arch/powerpc/include/asm
    
    from include/asm-powerpc.  This is the result of a
    
    mkdir arch/powerpc/include/asm
    git mv include/asm-powerpc/* arch/powerpc/include/asm
    
    Followed by a few documentation/comment fixups and a couple of places
    where <asm-powepc/...> was being used explicitly.  Of the latter only
    one was outside the arch code and it is a driver only built for powerpc.
