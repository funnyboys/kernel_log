    powerpc/mm: remove pmd_huge/pud_huge stubs and include hugetlb.h
    
    Patch series "hugetlbfs: convert macros to static inline, fix sparse
    warning".
    
    The definition for huge_pte_offset() in <linux/hugetlb.h> causes a
    sparse warning in the !CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE.  Fix this as well as
    converting all macros in this block of definitions to static inlines for
    better type checking.
    
    When making the above changes, build errors were found in powerpc due to
    duplicate definitions.  A separate powerpc specific patch is included as
    a requisite to remove the definitions and get them from
    <linux/hugetlb.h>.
    
    This patch (of 2):
    
    This removes the power specific stubs created by commit aad71e3928be
    ("powerpc/mm: Fix build break with RADIX=y & HUGETLBFS=n") used when
    !CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE.  Instead, it addresses the build break by getting
    the definitions from <linux/hugetlb.h>.  This allows the macros in
    <linux/hugetlb.h> to be replaced with static inlines.

    powerpc/mm/thp: update pmd_trans_huge to check for pmd_present
    
    We need to make sure pmd_trans_huge returns false for a pmd migration entry.
    We mark the migration entry by clearing the _PAGE_PRESENT bit. We keep the
    _PAGE_PTE bit set to indicate a leaf page table entry. Hence we need to make
    sure we check for pmd_present() so that pmd_trans_huge won't return true on
    pmd migration entry.

    With 4k page size for hugetlb we allocate hugepage directories from its on slab
    cache. With patch 0c4d26802 ("powerpc/book3s64/mm: Simplify the rcu callback for page table free")
    we missed to free these allocated hugepd tables.

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd
Author: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    powerpc/mm/radix: Add THP support for 4K linux page size
    
    This adds THP support for 4K Linux page size config with radix. We still
    don't do THP with 4K Linux page size and hash page table. Hash page
    table needs a 16MB hugepage and we can't do THP with 16MM hugepage and
    4K Linux page size.
    
    We add missing functions to 4K hash config to get it to build and
    hash__has_transparent_hugepage() makes sure we don't enable THP for 4K
    hash config. To catch wrong usage of THP related with 4K config, we add
    BUG() in those dummy functions we added to get it compile.

    powerpc/mm/radix: Add radix THP callbacks
    
    The deposited pgtable_t is a pte fragment hence we cannot use page->lru
    for linking then together. We use the first two 64 bits for pte fragment
    as list_head type to link all deposited fragments together. On withdraw
    we properly zero then out.

    powerpc/mm/radix: Add radix callback for pmd accessors
    
    This only does 64K Linux page support for now. 64K hash Linux config
    THP needs to differentiate it from hugetlb huge page because with THP we
    need to track hash pte slot information with respect to each subpage.
    This is not needed with hugetlb hugepage, because we don't do MPSS with
    hugetlb.
    
    Radix doesn't have any such restrictions.

    powerpc/mm: Move hugetlb and THP related pmd accessors to pgtable.h
    
    Here we create pgtable-64/4k.h and move pmd accessors that are common
    between hash and radix there. We can't do much sharing with 4K Linux
    page size because 4K Linux page size with hash config doesn't support
    THP. So for now it is empty. In later patches we will add functions that
    does conditional hash/radix accessors there.
