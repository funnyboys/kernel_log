commit 95ec77c06e8e63fff50c497eca0668bf6da39813
Author: Daniel Axtens <dja@axtens.net>
Date:   Tue Jul 12 10:54:52 2016 +1000

    powerpc: Make ppc_md.{halt, restart} __noreturn
    
    powernv marks it's halt and restart calls as __noreturn. However,
    ppc_md does not have this annotation. Add the annotation to ppc_md,
    and then to every halt/restart function that is missing it.
    
    Additionally, I have verified that all of these functions do not
    return. Occasionally I have added a spin loop to be sure.

commit b8b572e1015f81b4e748417be2629dfe51ab99f9
Author: Stephen Rothwell <sfr@canb.auug.org.au>
Date:   Fri Aug 1 15:20:30 2008 +1000

    powerpc: Move include files to arch/powerpc/include/asm
    
    from include/asm-powerpc.  This is the result of a
    
    mkdir arch/powerpc/include/asm
    git mv include/asm-powerpc/* arch/powerpc/include/asm
    
    Followed by a few documentation/comment fixups and a couple of places
    where <asm-powepc/...> was being used explicitly.  Of the latter only
    one was outside the arch code and it is a driver only built for powerpc.
