    kdb: core for kgdb back end (2 of 2)
    
    This patch contains the hooks and instrumentation into kernel which
    live outside the kernel/debug directory, which the kdb core
    will call to run commands like lsmod, dmesg, bt etc...

commit e8105903d78c81119754a42926951d9d17e191ba

    powerpc: Fix DEBUG_HIGHMEM build break from d4515646699
    
    Code was added to mm/higmem.c that depends on several
    kmap types that powerpc does not support.  We add dummy
    invalid definitions for KM_NMI, KM_NM_PTE, and KM_IRQ_PTE.
    
    According to list discussion, this fix should not be needed
    anymore starting with 2.6.33.  The code is commented to this
    effect so hopefully we will remember to remove this.

commit b8b572e1015f81b4e748417be2629dfe51ab99f9
Author: Stephen Rothwell <sfr@canb.auug.org.au>
Date:   Fri Aug 1 15:20:30 2008 +1000

    powerpc: Move include files to arch/powerpc/include/asm
    
    from include/asm-powerpc.  This is the result of a
    
    mkdir arch/powerpc/include/asm
    git mv include/asm-powerpc/* arch/powerpc/include/asm
    
    Followed by a few documentation/comment fixups and a couple of places
    where <asm-powepc/...> was being used explicitly.  Of the latter only
    one was outside the arch code and it is a driver only built for powerpc.
