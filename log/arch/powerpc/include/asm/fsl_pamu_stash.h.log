commit cd70d4659ff3ab7e25b29a6f70be5bcfd078db1f

    iommu/fsl: Various cleanups
    
    Currently a PAMU driver patch is very likely to receive some
    checkpatch complaints about the code in the context of the
    patch. This patch is an attempt to fix most of that and make
    the driver more readable
    
    Also fixed a subset of the sparse and coccinelle reported
    issues.

commit 7cabf491eb6d52ea7f166b287702890cae0c803d
Author: Varun Sethi <Varun.Sethi@freescale.com>
Date:   Mon Jul 15 10:20:56 2013 +0530

    iommu/fsl: Add additional iommu attributes required by the PAMU driver.
    
    Added the following domain attributes for the FSL PAMU driver:
    1. Added new iommu stash attribute, which allows setting of the
       LIODN specific stash id parameter through IOMMU API.
    2. Added an attribute for enabling/disabling DMA to a particular
       memory window.
    3. Added domain attribute to check for PAMUV1 specific constraints.
