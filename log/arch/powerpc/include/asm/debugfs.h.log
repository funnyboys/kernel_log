commit 7644d5819cf8956d799a0a0e5dc75f5a29889bd5
Author: Michael Ellerman <mpe@ellerman.id.au>
Date:   Fri Feb 10 12:04:56 2017 +1100

    powerpc: Create asm/debugfs.h and move powerpc_debugfs_root there
    
    powerpc_debugfs_root is the dentry representing the root of the
    "powerpc" directory tree in debugfs.
    
    Currently it sits in asm/debug.h, a long with some other things that
    have "debug" in the name, but are otherwise unrelated.
    
    Pull it out into a separate header, which also includes linux/debugfs.h,
    and convert all the users to include debugfs.h instead of debug.h.
