    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with no license
    
    Many user space API headers are missing licensing information, which
    makes it hard for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default are files without license information under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPLV2.  Marking them GPLV2 would exclude
    them from being included in non GPLV2 code, which is obviously not
    intended. The user space API headers fall under the syscall exception
    which is in the kernels COPYING file:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    otherwise syscall usage would not be possible.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with an SPDX
    license identifier.  The chosen identifier is 'GPL-2.0 WITH
    Linux-syscall-note' which is the officially assigned identifier for the
    Linux syscall exception.  SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.

    powerpc/kernel: Switch to using MAX_ERRNO
    
    Currently on powerpc we have our own #define for the highest (negative)
    errno value, called _LAST_ERRNO. This is defined to be 516, for reasons
    which are not clear.
    
    The generic code, and x86, use MAX_ERRNO, which is defined to be 4095.
    
    In particular seccomp uses MAX_ERRNO to restrict the value that a
    seccomp filter can return.
    
    Currently with the mismatch between _LAST_ERRNO and MAX_ERRNO, a seccomp
    tracer wanting to return 600, expecting it to be seen as an error, would
    instead find on powerpc that userspace sees a successful syscall with a
    return value of 600.
    
    To avoid this inconsistency, switch powerpc to use MAX_ERRNO.
    
    We are somewhat confident that generic syscalls that can return a
    non-error value above negative MAX_ERRNO have already been updated to
    use force_successful_syscall_return().
    
    I have also checked all the powerpc specific syscalls, and believe that
    none of them expect to return a non-error value between -MAX_ERRNO and
    -516. So this change should be safe ...
