commit f78541dcec327b0c46b150ee7d727f3db80275c4
Author: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>

    powerpc: Merge xmon
    
    The merged version follows the ppc64 version pretty closely mostly,
    and in fact ARCH=ppc64 now uses the arch/powerpc/xmon version.
    The main difference for ppc64 is that the 'p' command to call
    show_state (which was always pretty dodgy) has been replaced by
    the ppc32 'p' command, which calls a given procedure (so in fact
    the old 'p' command behaviour can be achieved with 'p $show_state').

+   ANSI C is assumed if __STDC__ is #defined.
+
+   Macro	ANSI C definition	Traditional C definition
+   -----	---- - ----------	----------- - ----------
+   PTR		`void *'		`char *'
+   LONG_DOUBLE	`long double'		`double'
+   VOLATILE	`volatile'		`'
+   SIGNED	`signed'		`'
+   PTRCONST	`void *const'		`char *'
+   ANSI_PROTOTYPES  1			not defined
+
+   CONST is also defined, but is obsolete.  Just use const.
+
+   DEFUN (name, arglist, args)
+
+	Defines function NAME.
+
+	ARGLIST lists the arguments, separated by commas and enclosed in
+	parentheses.  ARGLIST becomes the argument list in traditional C.
+
+	ARGS list the arguments with their types.  It becomes a prototype in
+	ANSI C, and the type declarations in traditional C.  Arguments should
+	be separated with `AND'.  For functions with a variable number of
+	arguments, the last thing listed should be `DOTS'.
+
+   DEFUN_VOID (name)
+
+	Defines a function NAME, which takes no arguments.
+
+   obsolete --     EXFUN (name, (prototype))	-- obsolete.
+
+	Replaced by PARAMS.  Do not use; will disappear someday soon.
+	Was used in external function declarations.
+	In ANSI C it is `NAME PROTOTYPE' (so PROTOTYPE should be enclosed in
+	parentheses).  In traditional C it is `NAME()'.
+	For a function that takes no arguments, PROTOTYPE should be `(void)'.
+
+    PARAMS ((args))
+
+	We could use the EXFUN macro to handle prototype declarations, but
+	the name is misleading and the result is ugly.  So we just define a
+	simple macro to handle the parameter lists, as in:
+
+	      static int foo PARAMS ((int, char));
+
+	This produces:  `static int foo();' or `static int foo (int, char);'
+
+	EXFUN would have done it like this:
+
+	      static int EXFUN (foo, (int, char));
+
+	but the function is not external...and it's hard to visually parse
+	the function name out of the mess.   EXFUN should be considered
+	obsolete; new code should be written to use PARAMS.
+
+    For example:
+	extern int printf PARAMS ((CONST char *format DOTS));
+	int DEFUN(fprintf, (stream, format),
+		  FILE *stream AND CONST char *format DOTS) { ... }
+	void DEFUN_VOID(abort) { ... }
