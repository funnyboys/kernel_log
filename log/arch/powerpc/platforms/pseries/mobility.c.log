    powerpc/pseries: Update hv-24x7 information after migration
    
    Function 'read_sys_info_pseries()' is added to get system parameter
    values like number of sockets and chips per socket.
    and it gets these details via rtas_call with token
    "PROCESSOR_MODULE_INFO".
    
    Incase lpar migrate from one system to another, system
    parameter details like chips per sockets or number of sockets might
    change. So, it needs to be re-initialized otherwise, these values
    corresponds to previous system values.
    This patch adds a call to 'read_sys_info_pseries()' from
    'post-mobility_fixup()' to re-init the physsockets and physchips values

    powerpc/pseries/mobility: use cond_resched when updating device tree
    
    After a partition migration, pseries_devicetree_update() processes
    changes to the device tree communicated from the platform to
    Linux. This is a relatively heavyweight operation, with multiple
    device tree searches, memory allocations, and conversations with
    partition firmware.
    
    There's a few levels of nested loops which are bounded only by
    decisions made by the platform, outside of Linux's control, and indeed
    we have seen RCU stalls on large systems while executing this call
    graph. Use cond_resched() in these loops so that the cpu is yielded
    when needed.

    powerpc/pseries/mobility: rebuild cacheinfo hierarchy post-migration
    
    It's common for the platform to replace the cache device nodes after a
    migration. Since the cacheinfo code is never informed about this, it
    never drops its references to the source system's cache nodes, causing
    it to wind up in an inconsistent state resulting in warnings and oopses
    as soon as CPU online/offline occurs after the migration, e.g.
    
      cache for /cpus/l3-cache@3113(Unified) refers to cache for /cpus/l2-cache@200d(Unified)
      WARNING: CPU: 15 PID: 86 at arch/powerpc/kernel/cacheinfo.c:176 release_cache+0x1bc/0x1d0
      [...]

      LR  release_cache+0x1b8/0x1d0
      Call Trace:
        release_cache+0x1b8/0x1d0 (unreliable)

    Using device tree notifiers won't work since we want to rebuild the
    hierarchy only after all the removals and additions have occurred and
    the device tree is in a consistent state. Call cacheinfo_teardown()
    before processing device tree updates, and rebuild the hierarchy
    afterward.

    powerpc/pseries/mobility: Extend start/stop topology update scope
    
    The powerpc mobility code may receive RTAS requests to perform PRRN
    (Platform Resource Reassignment Notification) topology changes at any
    time, including during LPAR migration operations.
    
    In some configurations where the affinity of CPUs or memory is being
    changed on that platform, the PRRN requests may apply or refer to
    outdated information prior to the complete update of the device-tree.
    
    This patch changes the duration for which topology updates are
    suppressed during LPAR migrations from just the rtas_ibm_suspend_me()
    / 'ibm,suspend-me' call(s) to cover the entire migration_store()
    operation to allow all changes to the device-tree to be applied prior
    to accepting and applying any PRRN requests.
    
    For tracking purposes, pr_info notices are added to the functions
    start_topology_update() and stop_topology_update() of 'numa.c'.

    powerpc/pseries: Remove unneeded uses of dlpar work queue
    
    There are three instances in which dlpar hotplug events are invoked;
    handling a hotplug interrupt (in a kvm guest), handling a dlpar
    request through sysfs, and updating LMB affinity when handling a
    PRRN event. Only in the case of handling a hotplug interrupt do we
    have to put the work on a workqueue, the other cases can handle the
    dlpar request directly.
    
    This patch exports the handle_dlpar_errorlog() function so that
    dlpar hotplug events can be handled directly and updates the two
    instances mentioned above to use the direct invocation.

    powerpc: Use octal numbers for file permissions
    
    Symbolic macros are unintuitive and hard to read, whereas octal constants
    are much easier to interpret.  Replace macros for the basic permission
    flags (user/group/other read/write/execute) with numeric constants
    instead, across the whole powerpc tree.
    
    Introducing a significant number of changes across the tree for no runtime
    benefit isn't exactly desirable, but so long as these macros are still
    used in the tree people will keep sending patches that add them.  Not only
    are they hard to parse at a glance, there are multiple ways of coming to
    the same value (as you can see with 0444 and 0644 in this patch) which
    hurts readability.

    powerpc/pseries: Fix parent_dn reference leak in add_dt_node()
    
    A reference to the parent device node is held by add_dt_node() for the
    node to be added. If the call to dlpar_configure_connector() fails
    add_dt_node() returns ENOENT and that reference is not freed.
    
    Add a call to of_node_put(parent_dn) prior to bailing out after a
    failed dlpar_configure_connector() call.

    powerpc: pseries: remove dlpar_attach_node dependency on full path
    
    In preparation to stop storing the full node path in full_name, remove the
    dependency on full_name from dlpar_attach_node(). Callers of
    dlpar_attach_node() already have the parent device_node, so just pass the
    parent node into dlpar_attach_node instead of the path. This avoids doing
    a lookup of the parent node by the path.

    powerpc/pseries: Update affinity for memory and cpus specified in a PRRN event
    
    Extend the existing PRRN infrastructure to perform the actual affinity
    updating for cpus and memory in addition to the device tree updating.
    For cpus, dynamic affinity updating already appears to exist in the
    kernel in the form of arch_update_cpu_topology(). For memory, we must
    place a READD operation on the hotplug queue for any phandle included in
    the PRRN event that is determined to be an LMB.

    powerpc: Update of_remove_property() call sites to remove null checking
    
    After obtaining a property from of_find_property() and before calling
    of_remove_property() most code checks to ensure that the property
    returned from of_find_property() is not null. The previous patch moved
    this check to the start of the function of_remove_property() in order to
    avoid the case where this check isn't done and a null value is passed.
    This ensures the check is always conducted before taking locks and
    attempting to remove the property. Thus it is no longer necessary to
    perform a check for null values before invoking of_remove_property().
    
    Update of_remove_property() call sites in order to remove redundant
    checking for null property value as check is now performed within the
    of_remove_property function().

    powerpc/pseries: Simplify check for suspendability during suspend/migration
    
    During suspend/migration operation we must wait for the VASI state reported
    by the hypervisor to become Suspending prior to making the ibm,suspend-me
    RTAS call. Calling routines to rtas_ibm_supend_me() pass a vasi_state variable
    that exposes the VASI state to the caller. This is unnecessary as the caller
    only really cares about the following three conditions; if there is an error
    we should bailout, success indicating we have suspended and woken back up so
    proceed to device tree update, or we are not suspendable yet so try calling
    rtas_ibm_suspend_me again shortly.
    
    This patch removes the extraneous vasi_state variable and simply uses the
    return code to communicate how to proceed. We either succeed, fail, or get
    -EAGAIN in which case we sleep for a second before trying to call
    rtas_ibm_suspend_me again. The behaviour of ppc_rtas() remains the same,
    but migrate_store() now returns the propogated error code on failure.
    Previously -1 was returned from migrate_store() in the  failure case which
    equates to -EPERM and was clearly wrong.

    powerpc/pseries: Introduce api_version to migration sysfs interface
    
    The /sys/kernel/mobility/migration interface was added all the way back
    in 2.6.37. However, the drmgr userspace tool was never augmented to use
    this interface to perfrom migrations. Instead it has continued using a
    faux rtas call coupled with performing the device tree update processing
    in userspace and communicating it back to the kernel via the ugly
    /proc/ppc64/ofdt interface.
    
    Up until 3.12 the device tree update code in the kernel was badly broken
    and bit rotting. This code was fixed in 3.12 and is now utilized by the
    kernel suspend code as of 3.15. The kernel is now better suited to
    handle the post-mobility fixup of the device tree and drmgr should be
    transitioned to using the sysfs migration interface.
    
    This patch introduces the api_version sysfs file to /sys/kernel/mobility
    as a means for drmgr to query the current implementation level of the
    kernel migration code. This initial versioning indicates it is capable
    of perfroming all current PAPR requirements for migration including the
    post-mobility firmware activation and device tree update.

    powerpc/pseries: Little endian fixes for post mobility device tree update
    
    We currently use the device tree update code in the kernel after resuming
    from a suspend operation to re-sync the kernels view of the device tree with
    that of the hypervisor. The code as it stands is not endian safe as it relies
    on parsing buffers returned by RTAS calls that thusly contains data in big
    endian format.
    
    This patch annotates variables and structure members with __be types as well
    as performing necessary byte swaps to cpu endian for data that needs to be
    parsed.

    powerpc/pseries: Fix endian problems with LE migration
    
    RTAS events require arguments be passed in big endian while hypercalls
    have their arguments passed in registers and the values should therefore
    be in CPU endian.
    
    The "ibm,suspend_me" 'RTAS' call makes a sequence of hypercalls to setup
    one true RTAS call. This means that "ibm,suspend_me" is handled
    specially in the ppc_rtas() syscall.
    
    The ppc_rtas() syscall has its arguments in big endian and can therefore
    pass these arguments directly to the RTAS call. "ibm,suspend_me" is
    handled specially from within ppc_rtas() (by calling rtas_ibm_suspend_me())
    which has left an endian bug on little endian systems due to the
    requirement of hypercalls. The return value from rtas_ibm_suspend_me()
    gets returned in cpu endian, and is left unconverted, also a bug on
    little endian systems.
    
    rtas_ibm_suspend_me() does not actually make use of the rtas_args that
    it is passed. This patch removes the convoluted use of the rtas_args
    struct to pass params to rtas_ibm_suspend_me() in favour of passing what
    it needs as actual arguments. This patch also ensures the two callers of
    rtas_ibm_suspend_me() pass function parameters in cpu endian and in the
    case of ppc_rtas(), converts the return value.
    
    migrate_store() (the other caller of rtas_ibm_suspend_me()) is from a
    sysfs file which deals with everything in cpu endian so this function
    only underwent cleanup.
    
    This patch has been tested with KVM both LE and BE and on PowerVM both
    LE and BE. Under QEMU/KVM the migration happens without touching these
    code pathes.
    
    For PowerVM there is no obvious regression on BE and the LE code path
    now provides the correct parameters to the hypervisor.

    powerpc/pseries: Switch pseries drivers to use machine_xxx_initcall()
    
    A lot of the code in platforms/pseries is using non-machine initcalls.
    That means if a kernel built with pseries support runs on another
    platform, for example powernv, the initcalls will still run.
    
    Most of these cases are OK, though sometimes only due to luck. Some were
    having more effect:
    
     * hcall_inst_init
      - Checking FW_FEATURE_LPAR which is set on ps3 & celleb.
     * mobility_sysfs_init
      - created sysfs files unconditionally
      - but no effect due to ENOSYS from rtas_ibm_suspend_me()
     * apo_pm_init
      - created sysfs, allows write
      - nothing checks the value written to though
     * alloc_dispatch_log_kmem_cache
      - creating kmem_cache on non-pseries machines

    powerpc/pseries: Device tree should only be updated once after suspend/migrate
    
    The current code makes rtas calls for update-nodes, activate-firmware and then
    update-nodes again. The FW provides the same data for both update-nodes calls.
    As a result a proc entry exists error is reported for the second update while
    adding device nodes.
    
    This patch makes a single rtas call for update-nodes after activating the FW.
    It also add rtas_busy delay for the activate-firmware rtas call.

    powerpc/pseries: Fix parsing of initial node path in update_dt_node
    
    On the first call to ibm,update-properties for a node the first property
    returned is the full node path. Currently this is not parsed correctly by the
    update_dt_node function. Commit 2e9b7b0 attempted to fix this, but was
    incorrect as it made a wrong assumption about the layout of the first
    property in the work area. Further, if ibm,update-properties must be called
    multiple times for the same node this special property should only be skipped
    after the initial call. The first property descriptor returned consists of
    the property name, property value length, and property value. The property
    name is an empty string, property length is encoded in 4 byte integer, and
    the property value is the node path.

    powerpc/pseries: Pack update_props_workarea to map correctly to rtas buffer header
    
    The work area buffer returned by the ibm,update-properties rtas call contains
    20 bytes of header information prior to the property value descriptor data.
    Currently update_dt_node tries to advance over this header using sizeof(upwa).
    The update_props_workarea struct contains 20 bytes worth of fields, that map
    to the relevant header data, but the sizeof the structure is 24 bytes due to
    4 bytes of padding at the end of the structure. Packing the structure ensures
    that we don't advance too far over the rtas buffer.

    powerpc/pseries: Fix over writing of rtas return code in update_dt_node
    
    The rc variable is initially used to store the return code from the
    ibm,update-properties rtas call which returns 0 or 1 on success. A return
    code of 1 indicates that ibm,update-properties must be called again for the
    node. However, the rc variable is overwritten by a call to update_dt_prop
    which returns 0 on success. This results in ibm,update-properties not being
    called again for the given node when the rtas call rc was previously 1.

    powerpc/pseries: Fix creation of loop in device node property list
    
    The update_dt_prop helper function fails to set the IN/OUT parameter prop to
    NULL after a complete property has been parsed from the work area returned by
    the ibm,update-properties rtas function. This results in the property list of
    the device node being updated is corrupted and becomes a loop since the same
    property structure is used repeatedly.

    powerpc/pseries: Correct buffer parsing in update_dt_node()
    
    Correct parsing of the buffer returned from ibm,update-properties. The first
    element is a length and the path to the property which is slightly different
    from the list of properties in the buffer so we need to specifically
    handle this.

    powerpc/pseries: Expose pseries devicetree_update()
    
    Newer firmware on Power systems can transparently reassign platform resources
    (CPU and Memory) in use. For instance, if a processor or memory unit is
    predicted to fail, the platform may transparently move the processing to an
    equivalent unused processor or the memory state to an equivalent unused
    memory unit. However, reassigning resources across NUMA boundaries may alter
    the performance of the partition. When such reassignment is necessary, the
    Platform Resource Reassignment Notification (PRRN) option provides a
    mechanism to inform the Linux kernel of changes to the NUMA affinity of
    its platform resources.
    
    When rtasd receives a PRRN event, it needs to make a series of RTAS
    calls (ibm,update-nodes and ibm,update-properties) to retrieve the
    updated device tree information. These calls are already handled in the
    pseries_devicetree_update() routine used in partition migration.
    
    This patch exposes pseries_devicetree_update() to make it accessible
    to other pseries routines, this patch also updates pseries_devicetree_update()
    to take a 32-bit scope parameter. The scope value, which was previously hard
    coded to 1 for partition migration, is used for the RTAS calls
    ibm,update-nodes/properties to update the device tree.

    powerpc/pseries: Partition migration in the kernel
    
    Enable partition migration in the kernel.  To do this a new sysfs file,
    /sys/kernel/mobility/migration, is created.  In order to initiate a migration
    the stream id (generated by the HMC managing the system) is written to this
    file.
    
    After a migration occurs, and what is the majority of this code, the device
    tree needs to be updated for the new system the partition is running on. This
    is done via the ibm,update-nodes and ibm,update-properties rtas calls which
    return information regarding which nodes and properties of the device tree
    are to be added/removed/updated.
