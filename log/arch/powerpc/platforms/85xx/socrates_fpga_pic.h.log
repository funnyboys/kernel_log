commit 393adcacadeea407925348b1a59ae8509ecffb3c
Author: Wolfgang Grandegger <wg@grandegger.com>
Date:   Sun Mar 22 14:58:43 2009 +0100

    powerpc/85xx: Add support for the "socrates" board (MPC8544).
    
    Supported are Ethernet, serial console, I2C, I2C-based RTC and
    temperature sensors, NOR and NAND flash, PCI, USB, CAN and Lime
    display controller.
    
    The multiplexing of FPGA interrupts onto PowerPC interrupt lines is
    supported through our own fpga_pic interrupt controller driver.
    
    For example the SJA1000 controller is level low sensitive connected to
    fpga_pic line 2 and is routed to the second (of three) irq lines to
    the CPU:
    
        can@3,100 {
                compatible = "philips,sja1000";
                reg = <3 0x100 0x80>;
                interrupts = <2 2>;
                interrupts = <2 8 1>;   // number, type, routing
                interrupt-parent = <&fpga_pic>;
        };
