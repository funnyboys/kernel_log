    powerpc: remove non-required uses of include <linux/module.h>
    
    None of the files touched here are modules, and they are not
    exporting any symbols either -- so there is no need to be including
    the module.h.  Builds of all the files remains successful.
    
    Even kernel/module.c does not need to include it, since it includes
    linux/moduleloader.h instead.
