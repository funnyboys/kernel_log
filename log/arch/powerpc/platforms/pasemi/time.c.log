commit 5bfd643583b2e2a203163fd6b617cd9027054200

    powerpc: use time64_t in read_persistent_clock
    
    Looking through the remaining users of the deprecated mktime()
    function, I found the powerpc rtc handlers, which use it in
    place of rtc_tm_to_time64().
    
    To clean this up, I'm changing over the read_persistent_clock()
    function to the read_persistent_clock64() variant, and change
    all the platform specific handlers along with it.

    [POWERPC] powerpc: PA Semi PWRficient platform support
    
    Base patch for PA6T and PA6T-1682M. This introduces the
    arch/powerpc/platform/pasemi directory, together with basic
    implementations for various setup.
    
    Much of this was based on other platform code, i.e. Maple, etc.
