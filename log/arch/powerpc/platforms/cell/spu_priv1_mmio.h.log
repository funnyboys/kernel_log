commit e28b003136b5b2f10c25b49c32df9b7742550c23
Author: Geoff Levand <geoffrey.levand@am.sony.com>

    [POWERPC] cell: abstract spu management routines
    
    This adds a platform specific spu management abstraction and the coresponding
    routines to support the IBM Cell Blade.  It also removes the hypervisor only
    resources that were included in struct spu.
    
    Three new platform specific routines are introduced, spu_enumerate_spus(),
    spu_create_spu() and spu_destroy_spu().  The underlying design uses a new
    type, struct spu_management_ops, to hold function pointers that the platform
    setup code is expected to initialize to instances appropriate to that platform.
    
    For the IBM Cell Blade support, I put the hypervisor only resources that were
    in struct spu into a platform specific data structure struct spu_pdata.
