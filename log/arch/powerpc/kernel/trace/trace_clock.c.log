commit 7853f9c029ac9134df42ea9e0d6bc600180f268d

    powerpc: Split ftrace bits into a separate file
    
    entry_*.S now includes a lot more than just kernel entry/exit code. As a
    first step at cleaning this up, let's split out the ftrace bits into
    separate files. Also move all related tracing code into a new trace/
    subdirectory.
    
    No functional changes.
