    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Make VP block size configurable
    
    The XIVE VP is an internal structure which allow the XIVE interrupt
    controller to maintain the interrupt context state of vCPUs non
    dispatched on HW threads.
    
    When a guest is started, the XIVE KVM device allocates a block of
    XIVE VPs in OPAL, enough to accommodate the highest possible vCPU
    id KVM_MAX_VCPU_ID (16384) packed down to KVM_MAX_VCPUS (2048).
    With a guest's core stride of 8 and a threading mode of 1 (QEMU's
    default), a VM must run at least 256 vCPUs to actually need such a
    range of VPs.
    
    A POWER9 system has a limited XIVE VP space : 512k and KVM is
    currently wasting this HW resource with large VP allocations,
    especially since a typical VM likely runs with a lot less vCPUs.
    
    Make the size of the VP block configurable. Add an nr_servers
    field to the XIVE structure and a function to set it for this
    purpose.
    
    Split VP allocation out of the device create function. Since the
    VP block isn't used before the first vCPU connects to the XIVE KVM
    device, allocation is now performed by kvmppc_xive_connect_vcpu().
    This gives the opportunity to set nr_servers in between:
    
              kvmppc_xive_create() / kvmppc_xive_native_create()
                                   .
                                   .
                         kvmppc_xive_set_nr_servers()
                                   .
                                   .
        kvmppc_xive_connect_vcpu() / kvmppc_xive_native_connect_vcpu()
    
    The connect_vcpu() functions check that the vCPU id is below nr_servers
    and if it is the first vCPU they allocate the VP block. This is protected
    against a concurrent update of nr_servers by kvmppc_xive_set_nr_servers()
    with the xive->lock mutex.
    
    Also, the block is allocated once for the device lifetime: nr_servers
    should stay constant otherwise connect_vcpu() could generate a boggus
    VP id and likely crash OPAL. It is thus forbidden to update nr_servers
    once the block is allocated.
    
    If the VP allocation fail, return ENOSPC which seems more appropriate to
    report the depletion of system wide HW resource than ENOMEM or ENXIO.
    
    A VM using a stride of 8 and 1 thread per core with 32 vCPUs would hence
    only need 256 VPs instead of 2048. If the stride is set to match the number
    of threads per core, this goes further down to 32.
    
    This will be exposed to userspace by a subsequent patch.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Ensure VP isn't already in use
    
    Connecting a vCPU to a XIVE KVM device means establishing a 1:1
    association between a vCPU id and the offset (VP id) of a VP
    structure within a fixed size block of VPs. We currently try to
    enforce the 1:1 relationship by checking that a vCPU with the
    same id isn't already connected. This is good but unfortunately
    not enough because we don't map VP ids to raw vCPU ids but to
    packed vCPU ids, and the packing function kvmppc_pack_vcpu_id()
    isn't bijective by design. We got away with it because QEMU passes
    vCPU ids that fit well in the packing pattern. But nothing prevents
    userspace to come up with a forged vCPU id resulting in a packed id
    collision which causes the KVM device to associate two vCPUs to the
    same VP. This greatly confuses the irq layer and ultimately crashes
    the kernel, as shown below.
    
    Example: a guest with 1 guest thread per core, a core stride of
    8 and 300 vCPUs has vCPU ids 0,8,16...2392. If QEMU is patched to
    inject at some point an invalid vCPU id 348, which is the packed
    version of itself and 2392, we get:
    
    genirq: Flags mismatch irq 199. 00010000 (kvm-2-2392) vs. 00010000 (kvm-2-348)

    powerpc/xive: Implement get_irqchip_state method for XIVE to fix shutdown race
    
    Testing has revealed the existence of a race condition where a XIVE
    interrupt being shut down can be in one of the XIVE interrupt queues
    (of which there are up to 8 per CPU, one for each priority) at the
    point where free_irq() is called.  If this happens, can return an
    interrupt number which has been shut down.  This can lead to various
    symptoms:
    
    - irq_to_desc(irq) can be NULL.  In this case, no end-of-interrupt
      function gets called, resulting in the CPU's elevated interrupt
      priority (numerically lowered CPPR) never gets reset.  That then
      means that the CPU stops processing interrupts, causing device
      timeouts and other errors in various device drivers.
    
    - The irq descriptor or related data structures can be in the process
      of being freed as the interrupt code is using them.  This typically
      leads to crashes due to bad pointer dereferences.
    
    This race is basically what commit 62e0468650c3 ("genirq: Add optional
    hardware synchronization for shutdown", 2019-06-28) is intended to
    fix, given a get_irqchip_state() method for the interrupt controller
    being used.  It works by polling the interrupt controller when an
    interrupt is being freed until the controller says it is not pending.
    
    With XIVE, the PQ bits of the interrupt source indicate the state of
    the interrupt source, and in particular the P bit goes from 0 to 1 at
    the point where the hardware writes an entry into the interrupt queue
    that this interrupt is directed towards.  Normally, the code will then
    process the interrupt and do an end-of-interrupt (EOI) operation which
    will reset PQ to 00 (assuming another interrupt hasn't been generated
    in the meantime).  However, there are situations where the code resets
    P even though a queue entry exists (for example, by setting PQ to 01,
    which disables the interrupt source), and also situations where the
    code leaves P at 1 after removing the queue entry (for example, this
    is done for escalation interrupts so they cannot fire again until
    they are explicitly re-enabled).
    
    The code already has a 'saved_p' flag for the interrupt source which
    indicates that a queue entry exists, although it isn't maintained
    consistently.  This patch adds a 'stale_p' flag to indicate that
    P has been left at 1 after processing a queue entry, and adds code
    to set and clear saved_p and stale_p as necessary to maintain a
    consistent indication of whether a queue entry may or may not exist.
    
    With this, we can implement xive_get_irqchip_state() by looking at
    stale_p, saved_p and the ESB PQ bits for the interrupt.
    
    There is some additional code to handle escalation interrupts
    properly; because they are enabled and disabled in KVM assembly code,
    which does not have access to the xive_irq_data struct for the
    escalation interrupt.  Hence, stale_p may be incorrect when the
    escalation interrupt is freed in kvmppc_xive_{,native_}cleanup_vcpu().
    Fortunately, we can fix it up by looking at vcpu->arch.xive_esc_on,
    with some careful attention to barriers in order to ensure the correct
    result if xive_esc_irq() races with kvmppc_xive_cleanup_vcpu().
    
    Finally, this adds code to make noise on the console (pr_crit and
    WARN_ON(1)) if we find an interrupt queue entry for an interrupt
    which does not have a descriptor.  While this won't catch the race
    reliably, if it does get triggered it will be an indication that
    the race is occurring and needs to be debugged.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Introduce a new mutex for the XIVE device
    
    The XICS-on-XIVE KVM device needs to allocate XIVE event queues when a
    priority is used by the OS. This is referred as EQ provisioning and it
    is done under the hood when :
    
      1. a CPU is hot-plugged in the VM
      2. the "set-xive" is called at VM startup
      3. sources are restored at VM restore
    
    The kvm->lock mutex is used to protect the different XIVE structures
    being modified but in some contexts, kvm->lock is taken under the
    vcpu->mutex which is not permitted by the KVM locking rules.
    
    Introduce a new mutex 'lock' for the KVM devices for them to
    synchronize accesses to the XIVE device structures.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Replace the 'destroy' method by a 'release' method
    
    When a P9 sPAPR VM boots, the CAS negotiation process determines which
    interrupt mode to use (XICS legacy or XIVE native) and invokes a
    machine reset to activate the chosen mode.
    
    We introduce 'release' methods for the XICS-on-XIVE and the XIVE
    native KVM devices which are called when the file descriptor of the
    device is closed after the TIMA and ESB pages have been unmapped.
    They perform the necessary cleanups : clear the vCPU interrupt
    presenters that could be attached and then destroy the device. The
    'release' methods replace the 'destroy' methods as 'destroy' is not
    called anymore once 'release' is. Compatibility with older QEMU is
    nevertheless maintained.
    
    This is not considered as a safe operation as the vCPUs are still
    running and could be referencing the KVM device through their
    presenters. To protect the system from any breakage, the kvmppc_xive
    objects representing both KVM devices are now stored in an array under
    the VM. Allocation is performed on first usage and memory is freed
    only when the VM exits.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Add passthrough support
    
    The KVM XICS-over-XIVE device and the proposed KVM XIVE native device
    implement an IRQ space for the guest using the generic IPI interrupts
    of the XIVE IC controller. These interrupts are allocated at the OPAL
    level and "mapped" into the guest IRQ number space in the range 0-0x1FFF.
    Interrupt management is performed in the XIVE way: using loads and
    stores on the addresses of the XIVE IPI interrupt ESB pages.
    
    Both KVM devices share the same internal structure caching information
    on the interrupts, among which the xive_irq_data struct containing the
    addresses of the IPI ESB pages and an extra one in case of pass-through.
    The later contains the addresses of the ESB pages of the underlying HW
    controller interrupts, PHB4 in all cases for now.
    
    A guest, when running in the XICS legacy interrupt mode, lets the KVM
    XICS-over-XIVE device "handle" interrupt management, that is to
    perform the loads and stores on the addresses of the ESB pages of the
    guest interrupts. However, when running in XIVE native exploitation
    mode, the KVM XIVE native device exposes the interrupt ESB pages to
    the guest and lets the guest perform directly the loads and stores.
    
    The VMA exposing the ESB pages make use of a custom VM fault handler
    which role is to populate the VMA with appropriate pages. When a fault
    occurs, the guest IRQ number is deduced from the offset, and the ESB
    pages of associated XIVE IPI interrupt are inserted in the VMA (using
    the internal structure caching information on the interrupts).
    
    Supporting device passthrough in the guest running in XIVE native
    exploitation mode adds some extra refinements because the ESB pages
    of a different HW controller (PHB4) need to be exposed to the guest
    along with the initial IPI ESB pages of the XIVE IC controller. But
    the overall mechanic is the same.
    
    When the device HW irqs are mapped into or unmapped from the guest
    IRQ number space, the passthru_irq helpers, kvmppc_xive_set_mapped()
    and kvmppc_xive_clr_mapped(), are called to record or clear the
    passthrough interrupt information and to perform the switch.
    
    The approach taken by this patch is to clear the ESB pages of the
    guest IRQ number being mapped and let the VM fault handler repopulate.
    The handler will insert the ESB page corresponding to the HW interrupt
    of the device being passed-through or the initial IPI ESB page if the
    device is being removed.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Add controls for the EQ configuration
    
    These controls will be used by the H_INT_SET_QUEUE_CONFIG and
    H_INT_GET_QUEUE_CONFIG hcalls from QEMU to configure the underlying
    Event Queue in the XIVE IC. They will also be used to restore the
    configuration of the XIVE EQs and to capture the internal run-time
    state of the EQs. Both 'get' and 'set' rely on an OPAL call to access
    the EQ toggle bit and EQ index which are updated by the XIVE IC when
    event notifications are enqueued in the EQ.
    
    The value of the guest physical address of the event queue is saved in
    the XIVE internal xive_q structure for later use. That is when
    migration needs to mark the EQ pages dirty to capture a consistent
    memory state of the VM.
    
    To be noted that H_INT_SET_QUEUE_CONFIG does not require the extra
    OPAL call setting the EQ toggle bit and EQ index to configure the EQ,
    but restoring the EQ state will.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: add a control to initialize a source
    
    The XIVE KVM device maintains a list of interrupt sources for the VM
    which are allocated in the pool of generic interrupts (IPIs) of the
    main XIVE IC controller. These are used for the CPU IPIs as well as
    for virtual device interrupts. The IRQ number space is defined by
    QEMU.
    
    The XIVE device reuses the source structures of the XICS-on-XIVE
    device for the source blocks (2-level tree) and for the source
    interrupts. Under XIVE native, the source interrupt caches mostly
    configuration information and is less used than under the XICS-on-XIVE
    device in which hcalls are still necessary at run-time.
    
    When a source is initialized in KVM, an IPI interrupt source is simply
    allocated at the OPAL level and then MASKED. KVM only needs to know
    about its type: LSI or MSI.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Enable use of the new XIVE "single escalation" feature
    
    That feature, provided by Power9 DD2.0 and later, when supported
    by newer OPAL versions, allows us to sacrifice a queue (priority 7)
    in favor of merging all the escalation interrupts of the queues
    of a single VP into a single interrupt.
    
    This reduces the number of host interrupts used up by KVM guests
    especially when those guests use multiple priorities.
    
    It will also enable a future change to control the masking of the
    escalation interrupts more precisely to avoid spurious ones.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S: Fix server always zero from kvmppc_xive_get_xive()
    
    In KVM's XICS-on-XIVE emulation, kvmppc_xive_get_xive() returns the
    value of state->guest_server as "server". However, this value is not
    set by it's counterpart kvmppc_xive_set_xive(). When the guest uses
    this interface to migrate interrupts away from a CPU that is going
    offline, it sees all interrupts as belonging to CPU 0, so they are
    left assigned to (now) offline CPUs.
    
    This patch removes the guest_server field from the state, and returns
    act_server in it's place (that is, the CPU actually handling the
    interrupt, which may differ from the one requested).

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Native usage of the XIVE interrupt controller
    
    This patch makes KVM capable of using the XIVE interrupt controller
    to provide the standard PAPR "XICS" style hypercalls. It is necessary
    for proper operations when the host uses XIVE natively.
    
    This has been lightly tested on an actual system, including PCI
    pass-through with a TG3 device.
