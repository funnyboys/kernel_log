commit 3fc2579e6f162fcff964f5aa01c8a29438ca5c05

    fls: change parameter to unsigned int
    
    When testing in userspace, UBSAN pointed out that shifting into the sign
    bit is undefined behaviour.  It doesn't really make sense to ask for the
    highest set bit of a negative value, so just turn the argument type into
    an unsigned int.
    
    Some architectures (eg ppc) already had it declared as an unsigned int,
    so I don't expect too many problems.
