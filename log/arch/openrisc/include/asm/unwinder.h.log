    openrisc: support framepointers and STACKTRACE_SUPPORT
    
    For lockdep support a reliable stack trace mechanism is needed.  This
    patch adds support in OpenRISC for the stacktrace framework, implemented
    by a simple unwinder api.  The unwinder api supports both framepointer
    and basic stack tracing.
    
    The unwinder is now used to replace the stack_dump() implementation as
    well. The new traces are inline with other architectures trace format:
    
     Call trace:
     [<c0004448>] show_stack+0x3c/0x58
     [<c031c940>] dump_stack+0xa8/0xe4
     [<c0008104>] __cpu_up+0x64/0x130
