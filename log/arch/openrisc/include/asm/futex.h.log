    futex: arch_futex_atomic_op_inuser() calling conventions change
    
    Move access_ok() in and pagefault_enable()/pagefault_disable() out.
    Mechanical conversion only - some instances don't really need
    a separate access_ok() at all (e.g. the ones only using
    get_user()/put_user(), or architectures where access_ok()
    is always true); we'll deal with that in followups.

    Remove 'type' argument from access_ok() function
    
    Nobody has actually used the type (VERIFY_READ vs VERIFY_WRITE) argument
    of the user address range verification function since we got rid of the
    old racy i386-only code to walk page tables by hand.
    
    It existed because the original 80386 would not honor the write protect
    bit when in kernel mode, so you had to do COW by hand before doing any
    user access.  But we haven't supported that in a long time, and these
    days the 'type' argument is a purely historical artifact.
    
    A discussion about extending 'user_access_begin()' to do the range
    checking resulted this patch, because there is no way we're going to
    move the old VERIFY_xyz interface to that model.  And it's best done at
    the end of the merge window when I've done most of my merges, so let's
    just get this done once and for all.
    
    This patch was mostly done with a sed-script, with manual fix-ups for
    the cases that weren't of the trivial 'access_ok(VERIFY_xyz' form.
    
    There were a couple of notable cases:
    
     - csky still had the old "verify_area()" name as an alias.
    
     - the iter_iov code had magical hardcoded knowledge of the actual
       values of VERIFY_{READ,WRITE} (not that they mattered, since nothing
       really used it)
    
     - microblaze used the type argument for a debug printout
    
    but other than those oddities this should be a total no-op patch.
    
    I tried to fix up all architectures, did fairly extensive grepping for
    access_ok() uses, and the changes are trivial, but I may have missed
    something.  Any missed conversion should be trivially fixable, though.

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    futex: Remove duplicated code and fix undefined behaviour
    
    There is code duplicated over all architecture's headers for
    futex_atomic_op_inuser. Namely op decoding, access_ok check for uaddr,
    and comparison of the result.
    
    Remove this duplication and leave up to the arches only the needed
    assembly which is now in arch_futex_atomic_op_inuser.
    
    This effectively distributes the Will Deacon's arm64 fix for undefined
    behaviour reported by UBSAN to all architectures. The fix was done in
    commit 5f16a046f8e1 (arm64: futex: Fix undefined behaviour with
    FUTEX_OP_OPARG_SHIFT usage). Look there for an example dump.
    
    And as suggested by Thomas, check for negative oparg too, because it was
    also reported to cause undefined behaviour report.
    
    Note that s390 removed access_ok check in d12a29703 ("s390/uaccess:
    remove pointless access_ok() checks") as access_ok there returns true.
    We introduce it back to the helper for the sake of simplicity (it gets
    optimized away anyway).
