commit 09abb90107202d3b18cf5a69076a1d05d11244e6
Author: Jonas Bonn <jonas@southpole.se>

    OpenRISC: System calls
    
    The OpenRISC Linux kernel conforms to the "generic" syscall interface which
    contains only the reduced set of syscalls deemed necessary for new
    architectures.  Unfortunately, the uClibc port for OpenRISC does not fully
    support this reduced set; as such, an additional patch available out-of-tree
    needs to be applied to the kernel in order to use the current uClibc.  This
    is just a temporary measure until the libc port can be straightened out; it
    is likely that OpenRISC will make the transition to glibc shortly where the
    generic syscall interface is better supported.
