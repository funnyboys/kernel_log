    mm: don't include asm/pgtable.h if linux/mm.h is already included
    
    Patch series "mm: consolidate definitions of page table accessors", v2.
    
    The low level page table accessors (pXY_index(), pXY_offset()) are
    duplicated across all architectures and sometimes more than once.  For
    instance, we have 31 definition of pgd_offset() for 25 supported
    architectures.
    
    Most of these definitions are actually identical and typically it boils
    down to, e.g.
    
    static inline unsigned long pmd_index(unsigned long address)
    {
            return (address >> PMD_SHIFT) & (PTRS_PER_PMD - 1);
    }
    
    static inline pmd_t *pmd_offset(pud_t *pud, unsigned long address)
    {
            return (pmd_t *)pud_page_vaddr(*pud) + pmd_index(address);
    }
    
    These definitions can be shared among 90% of the arches provided
    XYZ_SHIFT, PTRS_PER_XYZ and xyz_page_vaddr() are defined.
    
    For architectures that really need a custom version there is always
    possibility to override the generic version with the usual ifdefs magic.
    
    These patches introduce include/linux/pgtable.h that replaces
    include/asm-generic/pgtable.h and add the definitions of the page table
    accessors to the new header.
    
    This patch (of 12):
    
    The linux/mm.h header includes <asm/pgtable.h> to allow inlining of the
    functions involving page table manipulations, e.g.  pte_alloc() and
    pmd_alloc().  So, there is no point to explicitly include <asm/pgtable.h>
    in the files that include <linux/mm.h>.
    
    The include statements in such cases are remove with a simple loop:
    
            for f in $(git grep -l "include <linux/mm.h>") ; do
                    sed -i -e '/include <asm\/pgtable.h>/ d' $f
            done

    Merge tag 'spdx_identifiers-4.14-rc8' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-core
    
    Pull initial SPDX identifiers from Greg KH:
     "License cleanup: add SPDX license identifiers to some files
    
      Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
      makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
      By default all files without license information are under the default
      license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
      Update the files which contain no license information with the
      'GPL-2.0' SPDX license identifier. The SPDX identifier is a legally
      binding shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate
      text.
    
      This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart
      and Philippe Ombredanne.
    
      How this work was done:
    
      Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset
      of the use cases:
    
       - file had no licensing information it it.
    
       - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
    
       - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
      Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
      where non-standard license headers were used, and references to
      license had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
      The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied
      to a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of
      the output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver)
      producing SPDX tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.
      Philippe prepared the base worksheet, and did an initial spot review
      of a few 1000 files.
    
      The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537
      files assessed. Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the
      scanner results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license
      identifier(s) to be applied to the file. She confirmed any
      determination that was not immediately clear with lawyers working with
      the Linux Foundation.
    
      Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
    
       - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
    
       - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained
         >5 lines of source
    
       - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
         lines).
    
      All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
      The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
      identifiers to apply.
    
       - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
         considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
         COPYING file license applied.
    
         For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
           SPDX license identifier                            # files
           ---------------------------------------------------|-------
           GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
         and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
         If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
         Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0". Results of that
         was:
    
           SPDX license identifier                            # files
           ---------------------------------------------------|-------
           GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
         and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
       - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
         of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
         any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
         it (per prior point). Results summary:
    
           SPDX license identifier                            # files
           ---------------------------------------------------|------
           GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
           GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
           ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
           ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
           LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
           GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
           ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
           LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
           LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
           ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
           ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
         and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
       - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that
         became the concluded license(s).
    
       - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected
         a license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
         licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
       - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
         resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply
         (and which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
       - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
         confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
       - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
         the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
         in time.
    
      In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
      spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
      source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases,
      confirmation by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
      Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
      FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
      disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.
      The Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in
      part, so they are related.
    
      Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
      for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
      files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot
      checks in about 15000 files.
    
      In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
      copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect
      the correct identifier.
    
      Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
      inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial
      patch version early this week with:
    
       - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
         license ids and scores
    
       - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
         files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
    
       - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch
         license was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the
         applied SPDX license was correct
    
      This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction. This
      worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
      different types of files to be modified.
    
      These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg. Thomas wrote a script to
      parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
      format that the file expected. This script was further refined by Greg
      based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
      distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
      comment types.) Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
      generate the patches.

commit 814eae5982cc55988f642f7f1d10eaf340845c00
Author: Lorenzo Pieralisi <lorenzo.pieralisi@arm.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 26 15:54:15 2017 +0100

    alpha/PCI: Move pci_map_irq()/pci_swizzle() out of initdata
    
    The introduction of {map/swizzle}_irq() hooks in the struct pci_host_bridge
    allowed to replace the pci_fixup_irqs() PCI IRQ allocation in alpha arch
    PCI code with per-bridge map/swizzle functions with commit 0e4c2eeb758a
    ("alpha/PCI: Replace pci_fixup_irqs() call with host bridge IRQ mapping
    hooks").
    
    As a side effect of converting PCI IRQ allocation to the struct
    pci_host_bridge {map/swizzle}_irq() hooks mechanism, the actual PCI IRQ
    allocation function (ie pci_assign_irq()) is carried out per-device in
    pci_device_probe() that is called when a PCI device driver is about to be
    probed.
    
    This means that, for drivers compiled as loadable modules, the actual PCI
    device IRQ allocation can now happen after the system has booted so the
    struct pci_host_bridge {map/swizzle}_irq() hooks pci_assign_irq() relies on
    must stay valid after the system has booted so that PCI core can carry out
    PCI IRQ allocation correctly.
    
    Most of the alpha board structures pci_map_irq() and pci_swizzle() hooks
    (that are used to initialize their struct pci_host_bridge equivalent
    through the alpha_mv global variable - that represents the struct
    alpha_machine_vector of the running kernel) are marked as
    __init/__initdata; this causes freed memory dereferences when PCI IRQ
    allocation is carried out after the kernel has booted (ie when loading PCI
    drivers as loadable module) because when the kernel tries to bind the PCI
    device to its (module) driver, the function pci_assign_irq() is called,
    that in turn retrieves the struct pci_host_bridge {map/swizzle}_irq() hooks
    to carry out PCI IRQ allocation; if those hooks are marked as __init
    code/__initdata they point at freed/invalid memory.
    
    Fix the issue by removing the __init/__initdata markers from all subarch
    struct alpha_machine_vector.pci_map_irq()/pci_swizzle() functions (and
    data).

commit d5341942d784134f2997b3ff82cd63cf71d1f932
Author: Ralf Baechle <ralf@linux-mips.org>
Date:   Fri Jun 10 15:30:21 2011 +0100

    PCI: Make the struct pci_dev * argument of pci_fixup_irqs const.
    
    Aside of the usual motivation for constification,  this function has a
    history of being abused a hook for interrupt and other fixups so I turned
    this function const ages ago in the MIPS code but it should be done
    treewide.
    
    Due to function pointer passing in varous places a few other functions
    had to be constified as well.

    [PATCH] alpha pt_regs cleanups: device_interrupt
    
    callers of ->device_interrupt() do set_irq_regs() now; pt_regs argument
    removed, remaining uses of regs in instances of ->device_interrupt()
    are switched to get_irq_regs() and will be gone in the next patch.

    [PATCH] genirq: rename desc->handler to desc->chip
    
    This patch-queue improves the generic IRQ layer to be truly generic, by adding
    various abstractions and features to it, without impacting existing
    functionality.
    
    While the queue can be best described as "fix and improve everything in the
    generic IRQ layer that we could think of", and thus it consists of many
    smaller features and lots of cleanups, the one feature that stands out most is
    the new 'irq chip' abstraction.
    
    The irq-chip abstraction is about describing and coding and IRQ controller
    driver by mapping its raw hardware capabilities [and quirks, if needed] in a
    straightforward way, without having to think about "IRQ flow"
    (level/edge/etc.) type of details.
    
    This stands in contrast with the current 'irq-type' model of genirq
    architectures, which 'mixes' raw hardware capabilities with 'flow' details.
    The patchset supports both types of irq controller designs at once, and
    converts i386 and x86_64 to the new irq-chip design.
    
    As a bonus side-effect of the irq-chip approach, chained interrupt controllers
    (master/slave PIC constructs, etc.) are now supported by design as well.
    
    The end result of this patchset intends to be simpler architecture-level code
    and more consolidation between architectures.
    
    We reused many bits of code and many concepts from Russell King's ARM IRQ
    layer, the merging of which was one of the motivations for this patchset.
    
    This patch:
    
    rename desc->handler to desc->chip.
    
    Originally i did not want to do this, because it's a big patch.  But having
    both "desc->handler", "desc->handle_irq" and "action->handler" caused a
    large degree of confusion and made the code appear alot less clean than it
    truly is.
    
    I have also attempted a dual approach as well by introducing a
    desc->chip alias - but that just wasnt robust enough and broke
    frequently.
    
    So lets get over with this quickly.  The conversion was done automatically
    via scripts and converts all the code in the kernel.
    
    This renaming patch is the first one amongst the patches, so that the
    remaining patches can stay flexible and can be merged and split up
    without having some big monolithic patch act as a merge barrier.

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
