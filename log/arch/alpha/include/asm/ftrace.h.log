    tracing: make CALLER_ADDRx overwriteable
    
    The current definition of CALLER_ADDRx isn't suitable for all platforms.
    E.g. for ARM __builtin_return_address(N) doesn't work for N > 0 and
    AFAIK for powerpc there are no frame pointers needed to have a working
    __builtin_return_address.  This patch allows defining the CALLER_ADDRx
    macros in <asm/ftrace.h> and let these take precedence.
    
    Because now <asm/ftrace.h> is included unconditionally in
    <linux/ftrace.h> all archs that don't already had this include get an
    empty one for free.
