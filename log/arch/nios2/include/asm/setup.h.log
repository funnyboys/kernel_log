commit e118c3fec9c0d8d2a96462c4c035305dc952e402
Author: Tobias Klauser <tklauser@distanz.ch>
Date:   Thu May 11 11:40:16 2017 +0200

    nios2: remove custom early console implementation
    
    As of commits d8f347ba35cf ("nios2: enable earlycon support"),
    0dcc0542a006 ("serial: altera_jtaguart: add earlycon support") and
    4d9d7d896d77 ("serial: altera_uart: add earlycon support"), the nios2
    architecture and the altera_uart/altera_jtaguart drivers support
    earlycon. Thus, the custom early console implementation for nios2 is no
    longer necessary to get early boot messages. Remove it and rely fully on
    earlycon support.
