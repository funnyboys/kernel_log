commit 4b08478422040ae8cb11acc15d51f1cdb0ac39c8
Author: Guenter Roeck <linux@roeck-us.net>
Date:   Fri Aug 30 06:01:49 2013 -0700

    Drop support for Renesas H8/300 (h8300) architecture
    
    H8/300 has been dead for several years, and the kernel for it
    has not compiled for ages. Drop support for it.

    [h8300] move include/asm-h8300 to arch/h8300/include/asm
    
    Done as a script (well, a single "git mv" actually) on request from
    Yoshinori Sato as a way to avoid a huge diff.
