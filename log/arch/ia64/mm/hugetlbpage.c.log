    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    mm/hugetlb: add size parameter to huge_pte_offset()
    
    A poisoned or migrated hugepage is stored as a swap entry in the page
    tables.  On architectures that support hugepages consisting of
    contiguous page table entries (such as on arm64) this leads to ambiguity
    in determining the page table entry to return in huge_pte_offset() when
    a poisoned entry is encountered.
    
    Let's remove the ambiguity by adding a size parameter to convey
    additional information about the requested address.  Also fixup the
    definition/usage of huge_pte_offset() throughout the tree.

    mm: cleanup *pte_alloc* interfaces
    
    There are few things about *pte_alloc*() helpers worth cleaning up:
    
     - 'vma' argument is unused, let's drop it;
    
     - most __pte_alloc() callers do speculative check for pmd_none(),
       before taking ptl: let's introduce pte_alloc() macro which does
       the check.
    
       The only direct user of __pte_alloc left is userfaultfd, which has
       different expectation about atomicity wrt pmd.
    
     - pte_alloc_map() and pte_alloc_map_lock() are redefined using
       pte_alloc().

    Currently we have many duplicates in definitions of huge_pmd_unshare.  In

    CONFIG_ARCH_WANT_HUGE_PMD_SHARE is N.
    
    This patch puts the default implementation in mm/hugetlb.c and lets these

    mm/hugetlb: reduce arch dependent code around follow_huge_*
    
    Currently we have many duplicates in definitions around
    follow_huge_addr(), follow_huge_pmd(), and follow_huge_pud(), so this
    patch tries to remove the m.  The basic idea is to put the default
    implementation for these functions in mm/hugetlb.c as weak symbols
    (regardless of CONFIG_ARCH_WANT_GENERAL_HUGETL B), and to implement
    arch-specific code only when the arch needs it.
    
    For follow_huge_addr(), only powerpc and ia64 have their own
    implementation, and in all other architectures this function just returns
    ERR_PTR(-EINVAL).  So this patch sets returning ERR_PTR(-EINVAL) as
    default.
    
    As for follow_huge_(pmd|pud)(), if (pmd|pud)_huge() is implemented to
    always return 0 in your architecture (like in ia64 or sparc,) it's never
    called (the callsite is optimized away) no matter how implemented it is.
    So in such architectures, we don't need arch-specific implementation.
    
    In some architecture (like mips, s390 and tile,) their current
    arch-specific follow_huge_(pmd|pud)() are effectively identical with the
    common code, so this patch lets these architecture use the common code.
    
    One exception is metag, where pmd_huge() could return non-zero but it
    expects follow_huge_pmd() to always return NULL.  This means that we need
    arch-specific implementation which returns NULL.  This behavior looks
    strange to me (because non-zero pmd_huge() implies that the architecture
    supports PMD-based hugepage, so follow_huge_pmd() can/should return some
    relevant value,) but that's beyond this cleanup patch, so let's keep it.
    
    Justification of non-trivial changes:
    - in s390, follow_huge_pmd() checks !MACHINE_HAS_HPAGE at first, and this
      patch removes the check. This is OK because we can assume MACHINE_HAS_HPAGE
      is true when follow_huge_pmd() can be called (note that pmd_huge() has
      the same check and always returns 0 for !MACHINE_HAS_HPAGE.)
    - in s390 and mips, we use HPAGE_MASK instead of PMD_MASK as done in common
      code. This patch forces these archs use PMD_MASK, but it's OK because
      they are identical in both archs.
      In s390, both of HPAGE_SHIFT and PMD_SHIFT are 20.
      In mips, HPAGE_SHIFT is defined as (PAGE_SHIFT + PAGE_SHIFT - 3) and
      PMD_SHIFT is define as (PAGE_SHIFT + PAGE_SHIFT + PTE_ORDER - 3), but
      PTE_ORDER is always 0, so these are identical.

    hugetlb: restrict hugepage_migration_support() to x86_64
    
    Currently hugepage migration is available for all archs which support
    pmd-level hugepage, but testing is done only for x86_64 and there're
    bugs for other archs.  So to avoid breaking such archs, this patch
    limits the availability strictly to x86_64 until developers of other
    archs get interested in enabling this feature.
    
    Simply disabling hugepage migration on non-x86_64 archs is not enough to
    fix the reported problem where sys_move_pages() hits the BUG_ON() in
    follow_page(FOLL_GET), so let's fix this by checking if hugepage
    migration is supported in vma_migratable().

    mm: migrate: check movability of hugepage in unmap_and_move_huge_page()
    
    Currently hugepage migration works well only for pmd-based hugepages
    (mainly due to lack of testing,) so we had better not enable migration of
    other levels of hugepages until we are ready for it.
    
    Some users of hugepage migration (mbind, move_pages, and migrate_pages) do
    page table walk and check pud/pmd_huge() there, so they are safe.  But the
    other users (softoffline and memory hotremove) don't do this, so without
    this patch they can try to migrate unexpected types of hugepages.
    
    To prevent this, we introduce hugepage_migration_support() as an
    architecture dependent check of whether hugepage are implemented on a pmd
    basis or not.  And on some architecture multiple sizes of hugepages are
    available, so hugepage_migration_support() also checks hugepage size.

    thp: pte alloc trans splitting
    
    pte alloc routines must wait for split_huge_page if the pmd is not present
    and not null (i.e.  pmd_trans_splitting).  The additional branches are
    optimized away at compile time by pmd_trans_splitting if the config option
    is off.  However we must pass the vma down in order to know the anon_vma
    lock to wait for.

commit 5a0e3ad6af8660be21ca98a971cd00f331318c05
Author: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 24 17:04:11 2010 +0900

    include cleanup: Update gfp.h and slab.h includes to prepare for breaking implicit slab.h inclusion from percpu.h
    
    percpu.h is included by sched.h and module.h and thus ends up being
    included when building most .c files.  percpu.h includes slab.h which
    in turn includes gfp.h making everything defined by the two files
    universally available and complicating inclusion dependencies.
    
    percpu.h -> slab.h dependency is about to be removed.  Prepare for
    this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those
    headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion
    needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is
    used as the basis of conversion.
    
      http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py
    
    The script does the followings.
    
    * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that
      only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,
      gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.
    
    * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include
      blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms
      to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains
      core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -
      alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there
      doesn't seem to be any matching order.
    
    * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly
      because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out
      an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the
      file.
    
    The conversion was done in the following steps.
    
    1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly
       over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h
       and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400
       files.
    
    2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,
       some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or
       embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added
       inclusions to around 150 files.
    
    3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits
       from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.
    
    4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.
       e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab
       APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.
    
    5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically
       editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h
       files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h
       inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually
       wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each
       slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as
       necessary.
    
    6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.
    
    7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures
       were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my
       distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few
       more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things
       build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).
    
       * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.
       * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig
       * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig
       * ia64 SMP allmodconfig
       * s390 SMP allmodconfig
       * alpha SMP allmodconfig
       * um on x86_64 SMP allmodconfig
    
    8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as
       a separate patch and serve as bisection point.
    
    Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step
    6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch.
    If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch
    headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of
    the specific arch.

    GRU Driver: hardware data structures
    
    This series of patches adds a driver for the SGI UV GRU.  The driver is
    still in development but it currently compiles for both x86_64 & IA64.
    All simple regression tests pass on IA64.  Although features remain to be
    added, I'd like to start the process of getting the driver into the
    kernel.  Additional kernel drivers will depend on services provide by the
    GRU driver.
    
    The GRU is a hardware resource located in the system chipset.  The GRU
    contains memory that is mmaped into the user address space.  This memory
    is used to communicate with the GRU to perform functions such as
    load/store, scatter/gather, bcopy, AMOs, etc.  The GRU is directly
    accessed by user instructions using user virtual addresses.  GRU
    instructions (ex., bcopy) use user virtual addresses for operands.
    
    The GRU contains a large TLB that is functionally very similar to
    processor TLBs.  Because the external contains a TLB with user virtual
    address, it requires callouts from the core VM system when certain types
    of changes are made to the process page tables.  There are several MMUOPS
    patches currently being discussed but none has been accepted into the
    kernel.  The GRU driver is built using version V18 from Andrea Arcangeli.
    
    This patch:
    
    Contains the definitions of the hardware GRU data structures that are used
    by the driver to manage the GRU.

    hugetlb: modular state for hugetlb page size
    
    The goal of this patchset is to support multiple hugetlb page sizes.  This
    is achieved by introducing a new struct hstate structure, which
    encapsulates the important hugetlb state and constants (eg.  huge page
    size, number of huge pages currently allocated, etc).
    
    The hstate structure is then passed around the code which requires these
    fields, they will do the right thing regardless of the exact hstate they
    are operating on.
    
    This patch adds the hstate structure, with a single global instance of it
    (default_hstate), and does the basic work of converting hugetlb to use the
    hstate.
    
    Future patches will add more hstate structures to allow for different
    hugetlbfs mounts to have different page sizes.

    Do not depend on MAX_ORDER when grouping pages by mobility
    
    Currently mobility grouping works at the MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES level.  This makes
    sense for the majority of users where this is also the huge page size.
    However, on platforms like ia64 where the huge page size is runtime
    configurable it is desirable to group at a lower order.  On x86_64 and
    occasionally on x86, the hugepage size may not always be MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES.
    
    This patch groups pages together based on the value of HUGETLB_PAGE_ORDER.  It
    uses a compile-time constant if possible and a variable where the huge page
    size is runtime configurable.
    
    It is assumed that grouping should be done at the lowest sensible order and
    that the user would not want to override this.  If this is not true,
    page_block order could be forced to a variable initialised via a boot-time
    kernel parameter.
    
    One potential issue with this patch is that IA64 now parses hugepagesz with
    early_param() instead of __setup().  __setup() is called after the memory
    allocator has been initialised and the pageblock bitmaps already setup.  In
    tests on one IA64 there did not seem to be any problem with using
    early_param() and in fact may be more correct as it guarantees the parameter
    is handled before the parsing of hugepages=.

    hugepage: fix broken check for offset alignment in hugepage mappings
    
    For hugepage mappings, the file offset, like the address and size, needs to
    be aligned to the size of a hugepage.
    
    In commit 68589bc353037f233fe510ad9ff432338c95db66, the check for this was
    moved into prepare_hugepage_range() along with the address and size checks.
     But since BenH's rework of the get_unmapped_area() paths leading up to
    commit 4b1d89290b62bb2db476c94c82cf7442aab440c8, prepare_hugepage_range()
    is only called for MAP_FIXED mappings, not for other mappings.  This means
    we're no longer ever checking for an aligned offset - I've confirmed that
    mmap() will (apparently) succeed with a misaligned offset on both powerpc
    and i386 at least.
    
    This patch restores the check, removing it from prepare_hugepage_range()
    and putting it back into hugetlbfs_file_mmap().  I'm putting it there,
    rather than in the get_unmapped_area() path so it only needs to go in one
    place, than separately in the half-dozen or so arch-specific
    implementations of hugetlb_get_unmapped_area().

    [PATCH] shared page table for hugetlb page
    
    Following up with the work on shared page table done by Dave McCracken.  This
    set of patch target shared page table for hugetlb memory only.
    
    The shared page table is particular useful in the situation of large number of
    independent processes sharing large shared memory segments.  In the normal
    page case, the amount of memory saved from process' page table is quite
    significant.  For hugetlb, the saving on page table memory is not the primary
    objective (as hugetlb itself already cuts down page table overhead
    significantly), instead, the purpose of using shared page table on hugetlb is
    to allow faster TLB refill and smaller cache pollution upon TLB miss.
    
    With PT sharing, pte entries are shared among hundreds of processes, the cache
    consumption used by all the page table is smaller and in return, application
    gets much higher cache hit ratio.  One other effect is that cache hit ratio
    with hardware page walker hitting on pte in cache will be higher and this
    helps to reduce tlb miss latency.  These two effects contribute to higher
    application performance.

    [PATCH] hugetlb: prepare_hugepage_range check offset too
    
    (David:)
    
    If hugetlbfs_file_mmap() returns a failure to do_mmap_pgoff() - for example,
    because the given file offset is not hugepage aligned - then do_mmap_pgoff
    will go to the unmap_and_free_vma backout path.
    
    But at this stage the vma hasn't been marked as hugepage, and the backout path
    will call unmap_region() on it.  That will eventually call down to the
    non-hugepage version of unmap_page_range().  On ppc64, at least, that will
    cause serious problems if there are any existing hugepage pagetable entries in
    the vicinity - for example if there are any other hugepage mappings under the
    same PUD.  unmap_page_range() will trigger a bad_pud() on the hugepage pud
    entries.  I suspect this will also cause bad problems on ia64, though I don't
    have a machine to test it on.
    
    (Hugh:)
    
    prepare_hugepage_range() should check file offset alignment when it checks
    virtual address and length, to stop MAP_FIXED with a bad huge offset from
    unmapping before it fails further down.  PowerPC should apply the same
    prepare_hugepage_range alignment checks as ia64 and all the others do.
    
    Then none of the alignment checks in hugetlbfs_file_mmap are required (nor
    is the check for too small a mapping); but even so, move up setting of
    VM_HUGETLB and add a comment to warn of what David Gibson discovered - if
    hugetlbfs_file_mmap fails before setting it, do_mmap_pgoff's unmap_region
    when unwinding from error will go the non-huge way, which may cause bad
    behaviour on architectures (powerpc and ia64) which segregate their huge
    mappings into a separate region of the address space.

    [PATCH] hugepage: is_aligned_hugepage_range() cleanup
    
    Quite a long time back, prepare_hugepage_range() replaced
    is_aligned_hugepage_range() as the callback from mm/mmap.c to arch code to
    verify if an address range is suitable for a hugepage mapping.
    is_aligned_hugepage_range() stuck around, but only to implement
    prepare_hugepage_range() on archs which didn't implement their own.
    
    Most archs (everything except ia64 and powerpc) used the same
    implementation of is_aligned_hugepage_range().  On powerpc, which
    implements its own prepare_hugepage_range(), the custom version was never
    used.
    
    In addition, "is_aligned_hugepage_range()" was a bad name, because it
    suggests it returns true iff the given range is a good hugepage range,
    whereas in fact it returns 0-or-error (so the sense is reversed).
    
    This patch cleans up by abolishing is_aligned_hugepage_range().  Instead
    prepare_hugepage_range() is defined directly.  Most archs use the default
    version, which simply checks the given region is aligned to the size of a
    hugepage.  ia64 and powerpc define custom versions.  The ia64 one simply
    checks that the range is in the correct address space region in addition to
    being suitably aligned.  The powerpc version (just as previously) checks
    for suitable addresses, and if necessary performs low-level MMU frobbing to

    [IA64] Rationalise Region Definitions
    
    Currently, region numbers are defined in several files, with several
    names.  For example, we have REGION_KERNEL in asm/page.h and
    RGN_KERNEL in pgtable.h
    
    We also have address definitions that should depend on the
    RGN_XXX macros, but are currently just long constants.
    
    The following patch reorganises all the definitions so that they have
    the same form (RGN_XXX), are in one place, and that addresses that
    depend on RGN_XXX are derived from them.
    
    (This is a necessary but not sufficient patch to allow UML-like
    operation on IA64).
    
    Thanks to David Mosberger for catching the change I missed in mmu_context.h.

    [PATCH] Hugepage consolidation
    
    A lot of the code in arch/*/mm/hugetlbpage.c is quite similar.  This patch
    attempts to consolidate a lot of the code across the arch's, putting the
    combined version in mm/hugetlb.c.  There are a couple of uglyish hacks in
    order to covert all the hugepage archs, but the result is a very large
    reduction in the total amount of code.  It also means things like hugepage
    lazy allocation could be implemented in one place, instead of six.
    
    Tested, at least a little, on ppc64, i386 and x86_64.
    
    Notes:
            - this patch changes the meaning of set_huge_pte() to be more
              analagous to set_pte()
            - does SH4 need s special huge_ptep_get_and_clear()??

    [PATCH] freepgt: hugetlb_free_pgd_range
    
    ia64 and ppc64 had hugetlb_free_pgtables functions which were no longer being
    called, and it wasn't obvious what to do about them.
    
    The ppc64 case turns out to be easy: the associated tables are noted elsewhere
    and freed later, safe to either skip its hugetlb areas or go through the
    motions of freeing nothing.  Since ia64 does need a special case, restore to
    ppc64 the special case of skipping them.
    
    The ia64 hugetlb case has been broken since pgd_addr_end went in, though it
    probably appeared to work okay if you just had one such area; in fact it's
    been broken much longer if you consider a long munmap spanning from another
    region into the hugetlb region.
    
    In the ia64 hugetlb region, more virtual address bits are available than in
    the other regions, yet the page tables are structured the same way: the page
    at the bottom is larger.  Here we need to scale down each addr before passing
    it to the standard free_pgd_range.  Was about to write a hugely_scaled_down
    macro, but found htlbpage_to_page already exists for just this purpose.  Fixed
    off-by-one in ia64 is_hugepage_only_range.
    
    Uninline free_pgd_range to make it available to ia64.  Make sure the
    vma-gathering loop in free_pgtables cannot join a hugepage_only_range to any
    other (safe to join huges?  probably but don't bother).

    [PATCH] freepgt: free_pgtables use vma list
    
    Recent woes with some arches needing their own pgd_addr_end macro; and 4-level
    clear_page_range regression since 2.6.10's clear_page_tables; and its
    long-standing well-known inefficiency in searching throughout the higher-level
    page tables for those few entries to clear and free: all can be blamed on
    ignoring the list of vmas when we free page tables.
    
    Replace exit_mmap's clear_page_range of the total user address space by
    free_pgtables operating on the mm's vma list; unmap_region use it in the same
    way, giving floor and ceiling beyond which it may not free tables.  This
    brings lmbench fork/exec/sh numbers back to 2.6.10 (unless preempt is enabled,
    in which case latency fixes spoil unmap_vmas throughput).
    
    Beware: the do_mmap_pgoff driver failure case must now use unmap_region
    instead of zap_page_range, since a page table might have been allocated, and
    can only be freed while it is touched by some vma.
    
    Move free_pgtables from mmap.c to memory.c, where its lower levels are adapted
    from the clear_page_range levels.  (Most of free_pgtables' old code was
    actually for a non-existent case, prev not properly set up, dating from before
    hch gave us split_vma.) Pass mmu_gather** in the public interfaces, since we
    might want to add latency lockdrops later; but no attempt to do so yet, going
    by vma should itself reduce latency.
    
    But what if is_hugepage_only_range?  Those ia64 and ppc64 cases need careful
    examination: put that off until a later patch of the series.
    
    What of x86_64's 32bit vdso page __map_syscall32 maps outside any vma?
    
    And the range to sparc64's flush_tlb_pgtables?  It's less clear to me now that
    we need to do more than is done here - every PMD_SIZE ever occupied will be
    flushed, do we really have to flush every PGDIR_SIZE ever partially occupied?
    A shame to complicate it unnecessarily.
    
    Special thanks to David Miller for time spent repairing my ceilings.

    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
