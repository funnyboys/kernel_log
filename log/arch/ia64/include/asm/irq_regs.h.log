    [IA64] Move include/asm-ia64 to arch/ia64/include/asm
    
    After moving the the include files there were a few clean-ups:
    
    1) Some files used #include <asm-ia64/xyz.h>, changed to <asm/xyz.h>
    
    2) Some comments alerted maintainers to look at various header files to
    make matching updates if certain code were to be changed. Updated these
    comments to use the new include paths.
    
    3) Some header files mentioned their own names in initial comments. Just
    deleted these self references.
