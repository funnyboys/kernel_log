    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    smp_xxx barriers are removed as they are

    lcoking/barriers, arch: Use smp barriers in smp_store_release()
    
    With commit b92b8b35a2e ("locking/arch: Rename set_mb() to smp_store_mb()")
    it was made clear that the context of this call (and thus set_mb)
    is strictly for CPU ordering, as opposed to IO. As such all archs
    should use the smp variant of mb(), respecting the semantics and
    saving a mandatory barrier on UP.

    arch: Add lightweight memory barriers dma_rmb() and dma_wmb()
    
    There are a number of situations where the mandatory barriers rmb() and
    wmb() are used to order memory/memory operations in the device drivers
    and those barriers are much heavier than they actually need to be.  For
    example in the case of PowerPC wmb() calls the heavy-weight sync
    instruction when for coherent memory operations all that is really needed
    is an lsync or eieio instruction.
    
    This commit adds a coherent only version of the mandatory memory barriers
    rmb() and wmb().  In most cases this should result in the barrier being the
    same as the SMP barriers for the SMP case, however in some cases we use a
    barrier that is somewhere in between rmb() and smp_rmb().  For example on
    ARM the rmb barriers break down as follows:
    
      Barrier   Call     Explanation

      rmb()     dsb()    Data synchronization barrier - system
      dma_rmb() dmb(osh) data memory barrier - outer sharable
      smp_rmb() dmb(ish) data memory barrier - inner sharable
    
    These new barriers are not as safe as the standard rmb() and wmb().
    Specifically they do not guarantee ordering between coherent and incoherent
    memories.  The primary use case for these would be to enforce ordering of
    reads and writes when accessing coherent memory that is shared between the
    CPU and a device.
    
    It may also be noted that there is no dma_mb().  Most architectures don't
    provide a good mechanism for performing a coherent only full barrier without
    resorting to the same mechanism used in mb().  As such there isn't much to
    be gained in trying to define such a function.

commit 8a449718414ff10b9d5559ed3e8e09c7178774f2

    arch: Cleanup read_barrier_depends() and comments
    
    This patch is meant to cleanup the handling of read_barrier_depends and
    smp_read_barrier_depends.  In multiple spots in the kernel headers
    read_barrier_depends is defined as "do {} while (0)", however we then go
    into the SMP vs non-SMP sections and have the SMP version reference
    read_barrier_depends, and the non-SMP define it as yet another empty
    do/while.
    
    With this commit I went through and cleaned out the duplicate definitions
    and reduced the number of definitions down to 2 per header.  In addition I
    moved the 50 line comments for the macro from the x86 and mips headers that
    defined it as an empty do/while to those that were actually defining the
    macro, alpha and blackfin.

commit 47933ad41a86a4a9b50bed7c9b9bd2ba242aac63
Author: Peter Zijlstra <peterz@infradead.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 6 14:57:36 2013 +0100

    arch: Introduce smp_load_acquire(), smp_store_release()
    
    A number of situations currently require the heavyweight smp_mb(),
    even though there is no need to order prior stores against later
    loads.  Many architectures have much cheaper ways to handle these
    situations, but the Linux kernel currently has no portable way
    to make use of them.
    
    This commit therefore supplies smp_load_acquire() and
    smp_store_release() to remedy this situation.  The new
    smp_load_acquire() primitive orders the specified load against
    any subsequent reads or writes, while the new smp_store_release()
    primitive orders the specifed store against any prior reads or
    writes.  These primitives allow array-based circular FIFOs to be
    implemented without an smp_mb(), and also allow a theoretical
    hole in rcu_assign_pointer() to be closed at no additional
    expense on most architectures.
    
    In addition, the RCU experience transitioning from explicit
    smp_read_barrier_depends() and smp_wmb() to rcu_dereference()
    and rcu_assign_pointer(), respectively resulted in substantial
    improvements in readability.  It therefore seems likely that
    replacing other explicit barriers with smp_load_acquire() and
    smp_store_release() will provide similar benefits.  It appears
    that roughly half of the explicit barriers in core kernel code
    might be so replaced.
