    futex: arch_futex_atomic_op_inuser() calling conventions change
    
    Move access_ok() in and pagefault_enable()/pagefault_disable() out.
    Mechanical conversion only - some instances don't really need
    a separate access_ok() at all (e.g. the ones only using
    get_user()/put_user(), or architectures where access_ok()
    is always true); we'll deal with that in followups.

    Remove 'type' argument from access_ok() function
    
    Nobody has actually used the type (VERIFY_READ vs VERIFY_WRITE) argument
    of the user address range verification function since we got rid of the
    old racy i386-only code to walk page tables by hand.
    
    It existed because the original 80386 would not honor the write protect
    bit when in kernel mode, so you had to do COW by hand before doing any
    user access.  But we haven't supported that in a long time, and these
    days the 'type' argument is a purely historical artifact.
    
    A discussion about extending 'user_access_begin()' to do the range
    checking resulted this patch, because there is no way we're going to
    move the old VERIFY_xyz interface to that model.  And it's best done at
    the end of the merge window when I've done most of my merges, so let's
    just get this done once and for all.
    
    This patch was mostly done with a sed-script, with manual fix-ups for
    the cases that weren't of the trivial 'access_ok(VERIFY_xyz' form.
    
    There were a couple of notable cases:
    
     - csky still had the old "verify_area()" name as an alias.
    
     - the iter_iov code had magical hardcoded knowledge of the actual
       values of VERIFY_{READ,WRITE} (not that they mattered, since nothing
       really used it)
    
     - microblaze used the type argument for a debug printout
    
    but other than those oddities this should be a total no-op patch.
    
    I tried to fix up all architectures, did fairly extensive grepping for
    access_ok() uses, and the changes are trivial, but I may have missed
    something.  Any missed conversion should be trivially fixable, though.

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    futex: Remove duplicated code and fix undefined behaviour
    
    There is code duplicated over all architecture's headers for
    futex_atomic_op_inuser. Namely op decoding, access_ok check for uaddr,
    and comparison of the result.
    
    Remove this duplication and leave up to the arches only the needed
    assembly which is now in arch_futex_atomic_op_inuser.
    
    This effectively distributes the Will Deacon's arm64 fix for undefined
    behaviour reported by UBSAN to all architectures. The fix was done in
    commit 5f16a046f8e1 (arm64: futex: Fix undefined behaviour with
    FUTEX_OP_OPARG_SHIFT usage). Look there for an example dump.
    
    And as suggested by Thomas, check for negative oparg too, because it was
    also reported to cause undefined behaviour report.
    
    Note that s390 removed access_ok check in d12a29703 ("s390/uaccess:
    remove pointless access_ok() checks") as access_ok there returns true.
    We introduce it back to the helper for the sake of simplicity (it gets
    optimized away anyway).

    Wrong asm register contraints in the futex implementation
    
    The Linux Kernel contains some inline assembly source code which has
    wrong asm register constraints in arch/ia64/include/asm/futex.h.
    
    I observed this on Kernel 3.2.23 but it is also true on the most
    recent Kernel 3.9-rc1.
    
    File arch/ia64/include/asm/futex.h:
    
    static inline int
    futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic(u32 *uval, u32 __user *uaddr,
                                  u32 oldval, u32 newval)

            {
                    register unsigned long r8 __asm ("r8");
                    unsigned long prev;
                    __asm__ __volatile__(
                            "       mf;;                                    \n"
                            "       mov %0=r0                               \n"

                            "       .xdata4 \"__ex_table\", 1b-., 2f-.      \n"
                            "[2:]"
                            : "=r" (r8), "=r" (prev)
                            : "r" (uaddr), "r" (newval),
                              "rO" ((long) (unsigned) oldval)
                            : "memory");
                    *uval = prev;
                    return r8;
            }
    }
    
    The list of output registers is
                            : "=r" (r8), "=r" (prev)
    The constraint "=r" means that the GCC has to maintain that these vars
    are in registers and contain valid info when the program flow leaves
    the assembly block (output registers).
    But "=r" also means that GCC can put them in registers that are used
    as input registers. Input registers are uaddr, newval, oldval on the
    example.
    The second assembly instruction
                            "       mov %0=r0                               \n"
    is the first one which writes to a register; it sets %0 to 0. %0 means
    the first register operand; it is r8 here. (The r0 is read-only and
    always 0 on the Itanium; it can be used if an immediate zero value is
    needed.)
    This instruction might overwrite one of the other registers which are
    still needed.
    Whether it really happens depends on how GCC decides what registers it
    uses and how it optimizes the code.
    
    The objdump utility can give us disassembly.
    The futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic() function is inline, so we have to
    look for a module that uses the funtion. This is the
    cmpxchg_futex_value_locked() function in
    kernel/futex.c:
    
    static int cmpxchg_futex_value_locked(u32 *curval, u32 __user *uaddr,
                                          u32 uval, u32 newval)
    {
            int ret;
    
            pagefault_disable();
            ret = futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic(curval, uaddr, uval, newval);
            pagefault_enable();
    
            return ret;
    }
    
    Now the disassembly. At first from the Kernel package 3.2.23 which has
    been compiled with GCC 4.4, remeber this Kernel seemed to work:
    objdump -d linux-3.2.23/debian/build/build_ia64_none_mckinley/kernel/futex.o

    prepares the 'oldvalue' for the cmpxchg but it takes it from r8. This
    is wrong.
    What happened here is what I explained above: An input register is
    overwritten which is still needed.
    The register operand constraints in futex.h are wrong.
    
    (The problem doesn't occur when the Kernel is compiled with GCC 4.6.)
    
    The attached patch fixes the register operand constraints in futex.h.
    The code after patching of it:
    
    static inline int
    futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic(u32 *uval, u32 __user *uaddr,
                                  u32 oldval, u32 newval)
    {
            if (!access_ok(VERIFY_WRITE, uaddr, sizeof(u32)))
                    return -EFAULT;
    
            {
                    register unsigned long r8 __asm ("r8") = 0;
                    unsigned long prev;
                    __asm__ __volatile__(
                            "       mf;;                                    \n"
                            "       mov ar.ccv=%4;;                         \n"
                            "[1:]   cmpxchg4.acq %1=[%2],%3,ar.ccv          \n"
                            "       .xdata4 \"__ex_table\", 1b-., 2f-.      \n"
                            "[2:]"
                            : "+r" (r8), "=&r" (prev)
                            : "r" (uaddr), "r" (newval),
                              "rO" ((long) (unsigned) oldval)
                            : "memory");
                    *uval = prev;
                    return r8;
            }
    }
    
    I also initialized the 'r8' var with the C programming language.
    The _asm qualifier on the definition of the 'r8' var forces GCC to use
    the r8 processor register for it.
    I don't believe that we should use inline assembly for zeroing out a
    local variable.
    The constraint is
    "+r" (r8)
    what means that it is both an input register and an output register.
    Note that the page fault handler will modify the r8 register which
    will be the return value of the function.
    The real fix is
    "=&r" (prev)
    The & means that GCC must not use any of the input registers to place
    this output register in.
    
    Patched the Kernel 3.2.23 and compiled it with GCC4.4:

    ia64: fix futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic()
    
    Michel Lespinasse cleaned up the futex calling conventions in commit
    37a9d912b24f ("futex: Sanitize cmpxchg_futex_value_locked API").
    
    But the ia64 implementation was subtly broken.  Gcc does not know that
    register "r8" will be updated by the fault handler if the cmpxchg
    instruction takes an exception.  So it feels safe in letting the
    initialization of r8 slide to after the cmpxchg.  Result: we always
    return 0 whether the user address faulted or not.
    
    Fix by moving the initialization of r8 into the __asm__ code so gcc
    won't move it.

    futex: Sanitize futex ops argument types
    
    Change futex_atomic_op_inuser and futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic
    prototypes to use u32 types for the futex as this is the data type the
    futex core code uses all over the place.

    futex: Sanitize cmpxchg_futex_value_locked API
    
    The cmpxchg_futex_value_locked API was funny in that it returned either
    the original, user-exposed futex value OR an error code such as -EFAULT.
    This was confusing at best, and could be a source of livelocks in places
    that retry the cmpxchg_futex_value_locked after trying to fix the issue
    by running fault_in_user_writeable().
    
    This change makes the cmpxchg_futex_value_locked API more similar to the
    get_futex_value_locked one, returning an error code and updating the
    original value through a reference argument.

    [IA64] Move include/asm-ia64 to arch/ia64/include/asm
    
    After moving the the include files there were a few clean-ups:
    
    1) Some files used #include <asm-ia64/xyz.h>, changed to <asm/xyz.h>
    
    2) Some comments alerted maintainers to look at various header files to
    make matching updates if certain code were to be changed. Updated these
    comments to use the new include paths.
    
    3) Some header files mentioned their own names in initial comments. Just
    deleted these self references.
