    ia64: move exports to definitions
    
    Here we have another kind of deviation from the default case -
    a difference between exporting functions and non-functions.
    EXPORT_DATA_SYMBOL... is really different from EXPORT_SYMBOL...
    on ia64, and we need to use the right one when moving exports
    from *.c where C compiler has the required information to
    *.S, where we need to supply it manually.
    
    parisc64 will be another one like that.
