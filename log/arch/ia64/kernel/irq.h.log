    ia64: replace setup_irq() by request_irq()
    
    request_irq() is preferred over setup_irq(). Invocations of setup_irq()
    occur after memory allocators are ready.
    
    Per tglx[1], setup_irq() existed in olden days when allocators were not
    ready by the time early interrupts were initialized.
    
    Hence replace setup_irq() by request_irq().
    
    Changing 'ia64_native_register_percpu_irq' decleration to include
    'irq_handler_t' as an argument type in arch/ia64/include/asm/hw_irq.h
    was causing build error - 'unknown type name 'irq_handler_t''
    
    This was due to below header file sequence,
    + include/interrupt.h
     + include/hardirq.h
      + asm/hardirq.h
       + include/irq.h
        + asm/hw_irq.h
           [ 'ia64_native_register_percpu_irq' declared w/ 'irq_handler_t']
     [ 'irq_handler_t' typedef'ed here in 'include/interrupt.h']
    
    'register_percpu_irq' defined to 'ia64_native_register_percpu_irq' is
    the one invoked by the caller, not the latter directly. This was done
    to support paravirtualization which was removed around 4 years back.
    And 'register_percpu_irq' is invoked only inside 'arch/ia64/kernel'.
    
    So 'register_percpu_irq' define to 'ia64_native_register_percpu_irq' is
    removed, instead 'ia64_native_register_percpu_irq' is renamed to
    'register_precpu_irq()' & it is directly invoked. Also,
    'register_precpu_irq()' is declared in a new header file 'irq.h' inside
    'arch/ia64/kernel/', this header file is included by C files invoking
    'register_percpu_irq()'.
