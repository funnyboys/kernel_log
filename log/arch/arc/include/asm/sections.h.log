    ARC: SMP failed to boot due to missing IVT setup
    
    Commit 05b016ecf5e7a "ARC: Setup Vector Table Base in early boot" moved
    the Interrupt vector Table setup out of arc_init_IRQ() which is called
    for all CPUs, to entry point of boot cpu only, breaking booting of others.
    
    Fix by adding the same to entry point of non-boot CPUs too.
    
    read_arc_build_cfg_regs() printing IVT Base Register didn't help the
    casue since it prints a synthetic value if zero which is totally bogus,
    so fix that to print the exact Register.
    
    [vgupta: Remove the now stale comment from header of arc_init_IRQ and
    also added the commentary for halt-on-reset]

    ARC: [DeviceTree] Basic support
    
    This is minimal infrastructure needed for devicetree work.
    It uses an a sample "skeleton" devicetree - embedded in kernel image -
    to print the board, manufacturer by parsing the top-level "compatible"
    string.
    
    As of now we don't need any additional "board" specific "machine_desc".
    
    TODO: support interpreting the command line as boot-loader passed dtb

    ARC: Fundamental ARCH data-types/defines
    
    * L1_CACHE_SHIFT
    * PAGE_SIZE, PAGE_OFFSET
    * struct pt_regs, struct user_regs_struct
    * struct thread_struct, cpu_relax(), task_pt_regs(), start_thread(), ...
    * struct thread_info, THREAD_SIZE, INIT_THREAD_INFO(), TIF_*, ...

    * Elf_*
    
    To disallow user-space visibility into some of the core kernel data-types
    such as struct pt_regs, #ifdef __KERNEL__ which also makes the UAPI header
    spit (further patch in the series) to NOT export it to asm/uapi/ptrace.h
