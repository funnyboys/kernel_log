    ARC: UAPI Disintegrate arch/arc/include/asm
    
    1. ./genfilelist.pl arch/arc/include/asm/
    
    2. Create arch/arc/include/uapi/asm/Kbuild as follows
    
            +# UAPI Header export list
            +include include/uapi/asm-generic/Kbuild.asm
    
    3. ./disintegrate-one.pl arch/arc/include/{,uapi/}asm/<above-list>
    
    4. Edit arch/arc/include/asm/Kbuild to remove ref to
            asm-generic/Kbuild.asm
    
    - To work around empty uapi/asm/setup.h added a placholder comment.
    - Also a manual #ifdef __ASSEMBLY__ for a late ptrace change
