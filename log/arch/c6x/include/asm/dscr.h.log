commit 9de98fb4ec4c91597feedc521120c16fca54a5b6

    C6X: DSCR - Device State Configuration Registers
    
    All SoCs provide an area of device configuration registers called the DSCR. The
    location of specific registers as well as their use varies considerably from
    implementation to implementation. Rather than having to rely on additional
    SoC-specific DSCR code for each new supported SoC, this code generalize things
    as much as possible using device tree properties. Initialization must take
    place early on (setup_arch time) in case the event timer device needs to be
    enable via the DSCR.
