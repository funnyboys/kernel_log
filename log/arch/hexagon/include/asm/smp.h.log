    smp, hexagon: kill SMP single function call interrupt
    
    Commit 9a46ad6d6df3b54 "smp: make smp_call_function_many() use logic
    similar to smp_call_function_single()" has unified the way to handle
    single and multiple cross-CPU function calls. Now only one intterupt
    is needed for architecture specific code to support generic SMP function
    call interfaces, so kill the redundant single function call interrupt.
