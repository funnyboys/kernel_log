    Remove unneeded include of version.h from arch/hexagon/include/asm/spinlock_types.h
    
    "make versioncheck" points out that arch/hexagon/include/asm/spinlock_types.h
    does not need to include version.h .
    A quick look at the file seems to confirm its findings, so here's a patch that
    removes the include.
