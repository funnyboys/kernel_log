commit b1ddb5cc58dda42db21fc3e1c05bb6c28ac4d978
Author: Chen Gang <gang.chen.5i5j@gmail.com>

    arch: hexagon: kernel: reset.c: use function pointer instead of function for pm_power_off and export it
    
    'pm_power_off' is a function pointer, not a function, so need change
    its type, and also need export it, or can not pass compiling with
    allmodconfig. The related error:
    
        MODPOST 2879 modules
      ERROR: "pm_power_off" [drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_poweroff.ko] undefined!
