    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    sock: Introduce the SO_PEEK_OFF sock option
    
    This one specifies where to start MSG_PEEK-ing queue data from. When
    set to negative value means that MSG_PEEK works as ususally -- peeks
    from the head of the queue always.
    
    When some bytes are peeked from queue and the peeking offset is non
    negative it is moved forward so that the next peek will return next
    portion of data.
    
    When non-peeking recvmsg occurs and the peeking offset is non negative
    is is moved backward so that the next peek will still peek the proper
    data (i.e. the one that would have been picked if there were no non
    peeking recv in between).
    
    The offset is set using per-proto opteration to let the protocol handle
    the locking issues and to check whether the peeking offset feature is
    supported by the protocol the socket belongs to.

    net: add wireless TX status socket option
    
    The 802.1X EAPOL handshake hostapd does requires
    knowing whether the frame was ack'ed by the peer.
    Currently, we fudge this pretty badly by not even
    transmitting the frame as a normal data frame but
    injecting it with radiotap and getting the status
    out of radiotap monitor as well. This is rather
    complex, confuses users (mon.wlan0 presence) and
    doesn't work with all hardware.
    
    To get rid of that hack, introduce a real wifi TX
    status option for data frame transmissions.
    
    This works similar to the existing TX timestamping
    in that it reflects the SKB back to the socket's
    error queue with a SCM_WIFI_STATUS cmsg that has
    an int indicating ACK status (0/1).
    
    Since it is possible that at some point we will
    want to have TX timestamping and wifi status in a
    single errqueue SKB (there's little point in not
    doing that), redefine SO_EE_ORIGIN_TIMESTAMPING
    to SO_EE_ORIGIN_TXSTATUS which can collect more
    than just the timestamp; keep the old constant
    as an alias of course. Currently the internal APIs
    don't make that possible, but it wouldn't be hard
    to split them up in a way that makes it possible.
    
    Thanks to Neil Horman for helping me figure out
    the functions that add the control messages.

    net: Generalize socket rx gap / receive queue overflow cmsg
    
    Create a new socket level option to report number of queue overflows
    
    Recently I augmented the AF_PACKET protocol to report the number of frames lost
    on the socket receive queue between any two enqueued frames.  This value was
    exported via a SOL_PACKET level cmsg.  AFter I completed that work it was
    requested that this feature be generalized so that any datagram oriented socket
    could make use of this option.  As such I've created this patch, It creates a
    new SOL_SOCKET level option called SO_RXQ_OVFL, which when enabled exports a
    SOL_SOCKET level cmsg that reports the nubmer of times the sk_receive_queue
    overflowed between any two given frames.  It also augments the AF_PACKET
    protocol to take advantage of this new feature (as it previously did not touch
    sk->sk_drops, which this patch uses to record the overflow count).  Tested
    successfully by me.
    
    Notes:
    
    1) Unlike my previous patch, this patch simply records the sk_drops value, which
    is not a number of drops between packets, but rather a total number of drops.
    Deltas must be computed in user space.
    
    2) While this patch currently works with datagram oriented protocols, it will
    also be accepted by non-datagram oriented protocols. I'm not sure if thats
    agreeable to everyone, but my argument in favor of doing so is that, for those
    protocols which aren't applicable to this option, sk_drops will always be zero,
    and reporting no drops on a receive queue that isn't used for those
    non-participating protocols seems reasonable to me.  This also saves us having
    to code in a per-protocol opt in mechanism.
    
    3) This applies cleanly to net-next assuming that commit
    977750076d98c7ff6cbda51858bb5a5894a9d9ab (my af packet cmsg patch) is reverted

    net: implement a SO_PROTOCOL getsockoption
    
    Similar to SO_TYPE returning the socket type, SO_PROTOCOL allows to
    retrieve the protocol used with a given socket.
    
    I am not quite sure why we have that-many copies of socket.h, and why
    the values are not the same on all arches either, but for where hex
    numbers dominate, I use 0x1029 for SO_PROTOCOL as that seems to be
    the next free unused number across a bunch of operating systems, or
    so Google results make me want to believe. SO_PROTOCOL for others
    just uses the next free Linux number, 38.

    net: new user space API for time stamping of incoming and outgoing packets
    
    User space can request hardware and/or software time stamping.
    Reporting of the result(s) via a new control message is enabled
    separately for each field in the message because some of the
    fields may require additional computation and thus cause overhead.
    User space can tell the different kinds of time stamps apart
    and choose what suits its needs.
    
    When a TX timestamp operation is requested, the TX skb will be cloned
    and the clone will be time stamped (in hardware or software) and added
    to the socket error queue of the skb, if the skb has a socket
    associated with it.
    
    The actual TX timestamp will reach userspace as a RX timestamp on the
    cloned packet. If timestamping is requested and no timestamping is
    done in the device driver (potentially this may use hardware
    timestamping), it will be done in software after the device's
    start_hard_xmit routine.
