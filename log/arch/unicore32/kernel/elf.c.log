commit 87c1a3fb7c07322dfd63a63dd6d42339ad52ddee

    unicore32 core architecture: generic elf and ksyms stuff
    
    This patch includes some generic stuff including elf and ksyms.
    Because all one-line asm-generic headers are auto-generated by ASM_GENERIC_HEADERS
    in arch/unicore32/Makefile, so the rest seems very little.
    ELF handling functions and module handling functions are also here.
