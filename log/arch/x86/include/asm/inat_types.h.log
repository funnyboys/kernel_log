commit eb13296cfaf6c699566473669a96a38a90562384
Author: Masami Hiramatsu <mhiramat@redhat.com>

    x86: Instruction decoder API
    
    Add x86 instruction decoder to arch-specific libraries. This decoder
    can decode x86 instructions used in kernel into prefix, opcode, modrm,
    sib, displacement and immediates. This can also show the length of
    instructions.
    
    This version introduces instruction attributes for decoding
    instructions.
    The instruction attribute tables are generated from the opcode map file
    (x86-opcode-map.txt) by the generator script(gen-insn-attr-x86.awk).
    
    Currently, the opcode maps are based on opcode maps in Intel(R) 64 and
    IA-32 Architectures Software Developers Manual Vol.2: Appendix.A,
    and consist of below two types of opcode tables.
    
    1-byte/2-bytes/3-bytes opcodes, which has 256 elements, are
    written as below;
    
     Table: table-name
     Referrer: escaped-name
     opcode: mnemonic|GrpXXX [operand1[,operand2...]] [(extra1)[,(extra2)...] [| 2nd-mnemonic ...]
      (or)
     opcode: escape # escaped-name
     EndTable
    
    Group opcodes, which has 8 elements, are written as below;
    
     GrpTable: GrpXXX
     reg:  mnemonic [operand1[,operand2...]] [(extra1)[,(extra2)...] [| 2nd-mnemonic ...]
     EndTable
    
    These opcode maps include a few SSE and FP opcodes (for setup), because
    those opcodes are used in the kernel.
