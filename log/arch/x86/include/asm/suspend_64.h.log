    x86/paravirt: Drop {read,write}_cr8() hooks
    
    There is a lot of infrastructure for functionality which is used
    exclusively in __{save,restore}_processor_state() on the suspend/resume
    path.
    
    cr8 is an alias of APIC_TASKPRI, and APIC_TASKPRI is saved/restored by
    lapic_{suspend,resume}().  Saving and restoring cr8 independently of the
    rest of the Local APIC state isn't a clever thing to be doing.
    
    Delete the suspend/resume cr8 handling, which shrinks the size of struct
    saved_context, and allows for the removal of both PVOPS.

    x86/power: Make restore_processor_context() sane
    
    My previous attempt to fix a couple of bugs in __restore_processor_context():
    
      5b06bbcfc2c6 ("x86/power: Fix some ordering bugs in __restore_processor_context()")
    
    ... introduced yet another bug, breaking suspend-resume.
    
    Rather than trying to come up with a minimal fix, let's try to clean it up
    for real.  This patch fixes quite a few things:
    
     - The old code saved a nonsensical subset of segment registers.
       The only registers that need to be saved are those that contain
       userspace state or those that can't be trivially restored without
       percpu access working.  (On x86_32, we can restore percpu access
       by writing __KERNEL_PERCPU to %fs.  On x86_64, it's easier to
       save and restore the kernel's GSBASE.)  With this patch, we
       restore hardcoded values to the kernel state where applicable and
       explicitly restore the user state after fixing all the descriptor
       tables.
    
     - We used to use an unholy mix of inline asm and C helpers for
       segment register access.  Let's get rid of the inline asm.
    
    This fixes the reported s2ram hangs and make the code all around
    more logical.

    x86/power/64: Use struct desc_ptr for the IDT in struct saved_context
    
    x86_64's saved_context nonsensically used separate idt_limit and
    idt_base fields and then cast &idt_limit to struct desc_ptr *.
    
    This was correct (with -fno-strict-aliasing), but it's confusing,
    served no purpose, and required #ifdeffery. Simplify this by
    using struct desc_ptr directly.
    
    No change in functionality.

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    x86/power/64: Use char arrays for asm function names
    
    This switches the hibernate_64.S function names into character arrays
    to match other areas of the kernel where this is done (e.g., linker
    scripts). Specifically this fixes a compile-time error noticed by the
    future CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE routines that complained about PAGE_SIZE
    being copied out of the "single byte" core_restore_code variable.
    
    Additionally drops the "acpi_save_state_mem" exern which does not
    appear to be used anywhere else in the kernel.

    x86/pm: Introduce quirk framework to save/restore extra MSR registers around suspend/resume
    
    A bug was reported that on certain Broadwell platforms, after
    resuming from S3, the CPU is running at an anomalously low
    speed.
    
    It turns out that the BIOS has modified the value of the
    THERM_CONTROL register during S3, and changed it from 0 to 0x10,
    thus enabled clock modulation(bit4), but with undefined CPU Duty
    Cycle(bit1:3) - which causes the problem.
    
    Here is a simple scenario to reproduce the issue:
    
     1. Boot up the system
     2. Get MSR 0x19a, it should be 0
     3. Put the system into sleep, then wake it up
     4. Get MSR 0x19a, it shows 0x10, while it should be 0
    
    Although some BIOSen want to change the CPU Duty Cycle during
    S3, in our case we don't want the BIOS to do any modification.
    
    Fix this issue by introducing a more generic x86 framework to
    save/restore specified MSR registers(THERM_CONTROL in this case)
    for suspend/resume. This allows us to fix similar bugs in a much
    simpler way in the future.
    
    When the kernel wants to protect certain MSRs during suspending,
    we simply add a quirk entry in msr_save_dmi_table, and customize
    the MSR registers inside the quirk callback, for example:
    
      u32 msr_id_need_to_save[] = {MSR_ID0, MSR_ID1, MSR_ID2...};
    
    and the quirk mechanism ensures that, once resumed from suspend,
    the MSRs indicated by these IDs will be restored to their
    original, pre-suspend values.
    
    Since both 64-bit and 32-bit kernels are affected, this patch
    covers the common 64/32-bit suspend/resume code path. And
    because the MSRs specified by the user might not be available or
    readable in any situation, we use rdmsrl_safe() to safely save
    these MSRs.

commit cc456c4e7cac3837a86aaa7ca3cb9f488d44d196

    x86, gdt, hibernate: Store/load GDT for hibernate path.
    
    The git commite7a5cd063c7b4c58417f674821d63f5eb6747e37
    ("x86-64, gdt: Store/load GDT for ACPI S3 or hibernate/resume path
    is not needed.") assumes that for the hibernate path the booting
    kernel and the resuming kernel MUST be the same. That is certainly
    the case for a 32-bit kernel (see check_image_kernel and
    CONFIG_ARCH_HIBERNATION_HEADER config option).
    
    However for 64-bit kernels it is OK to have a different kernel
    version (and size of the image) of the booting and resuming kernels.
    Hence the above mentioned git commit introduces an regression.
    
    This patch fixes it by introducing a 'struct desc_ptr gdt_desc'
    back in the 'struct saved_context'. However instead of having in the
    'save_processor_state' and 'restore_processor_state' the
    store/load_gdt calls, we are only saving the GDT in the
    save_processor_state.
    
    For the restore path the lgdt operation is done in
    hibernate_asm_[32|64].S in the 'restore_registers' path.
    
    The apt reader of this description will recognize that only 64-bit
    kernels need this treatment, not 32-bit. This patch adds the logic
    in the 32-bit path to be more similar to 64-bit so that in the future
    the unification process can take advantage of this.
    
    [ hpa: this also reverts an inadvertent on-disk format change ]

commit e7a5cd063c7b4c58417f674821d63f5eb6747e37

    x86-64, gdt: Store/load GDT for ACPI S3 or hibernate/resume path is not needed.
    
    During the ACPI S3 resume path the trampoline code handles it already.
    
    During the ACPI S3 suspend phase (acpi_suspend_lowlevel) we set:
    early_gdt_descr.address = (..)get_cpu_gdt_table(smp_processor_id());
    
    which is then used during the resume path and has the same exact
    value as what the store/load_gdt do with the saved_context
    (which is saved/restored via save/restore_processor_state()).
    
    The flow during resume is complex and for 64-bit kernels we use three GDTs
    - one early bootstrap GDT (wakeup_igdt) that we load to workaround
    broken BIOSes, an early Protected Mode to Long Mode transition one
    (tr_gdt), and the final one - early_gdt_descr (which points to the real GDT).
    
    The early ('wakeup_gdt') is loaded in 'trampoline_start' for working
    around broken BIOSes, and then when we end up in Protected Mode in the
    startup_32 (in trampoline_64.s, not head_32.s) we use the 'tr_gdt'
    (still in trampoline_64.s). This 'tr_gdt' has a a 32-bit code segment,
    64-bit code segment with L=1, and a 32-bit data segment.
    
    Once we have transitioned from Protected Mode to Long Mode we then
    set the GDT to 'early_gdt_desc' and then via an iretq emerge in
    wakeup_long64 (set via 'initial_code' variable in acpi_suspend_lowlevel).
    
    In the wakeup_long64 we end up restoring the %rip (which is set to
    'resume_point') and jump there.
    
    In 'resume_point' we call 'restore_processor_state' which does
    the load_gdt on the saved context. This load_gdt is redundant as the
    GDT loaded via early_gdt_desc is the same.
    
    Here is the call-chain:
     wakeup_start
       |- lgdtl wakeup_gdt [the work-around broken BIOSes]
       |
       \-- trampoline_start (trampoline_64.S)
             |- lgdtl tr_gdt
             |
             \-- startup_32 (trampoline_64.S)
                   |
                   \-- startup_64 (trampoline_64.S)
                          |
                          \-- secondary_startup_64
                                   |- lgdtl early_gdt_desc
                                   | ...
                                   |- movq initial_code(%rip), %eax
                                   |-.. lretq
                                   \-- wakeup_64
                                         |-- other registers are reloaded
                                         |-- call restore_processor_state
    
    The hibernate path is much simpler. During the saving of the hibernation
    image we call save_processor_state() and save the contents of that along
    with the rest of the kernel in the hibernation image destination.
    We save the EIP of 'restore_registers' (restore_jump_address) and cr3
    (restore_cr3).
    
    During hibernate resume, the 'restore_registers' (via the
    'restore_jump_address) in hibernate_asm_64.S is invoked which restores
    the contents of most registers. Naturally the resume path benefits from
    already being in 64-bit mode, so it does not have to load the GDT.
    
    It only reloads the cr3 (from restore_cr3) and continues on. Note that
    the restoration of the restore image page-tables is done prior to this.
    
    After the 'restore_registers' it returns and we end up called
    restore_processor_state() - where we reload the GDT. The reload of
    the GDT is not needed as bootup kernel has already loaded the GDT which
    is at the same physical location as the the restored kernel.
    
    Note that the hibernation path assumes the GDT is correct during its
    'restore_registers'. The assumption in the code is that the restored
    image is the same as saved - meaning we are not trying to restore
    an different kernel in the virtual address space of a new kernel.
