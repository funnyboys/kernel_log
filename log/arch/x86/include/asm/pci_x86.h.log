    x86/PCI: Add "pci=big_root_window" option for AMD 64-bit windows
    
    Only try to enable a 64-bit window on AMD CPUs when "pci=big_root_window"
    is specified.
    
    This taints the kernel because the new 64-bit window uses address space we
    don't know anything about, and it may contain unreported devices or memory
    that would conflict with the window.
    
    The pci_amd_enable_64bit_bar() quirk that enables the window is specific to
    AMD CPUs.  The generic solution would be to have the firmware enable the
    window and describe it in the host bridge's _CRS method, or at least
    describe it in the _PRS method so the OS would have the option of enabling
    it.

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd
Author: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    x86/boot/e820: Remove spurious asm/e820/api.h inclusions
    
    A commonly used lowlevel x86 header, asm/pgtable.h, includes asm/e820/api.h
    spuriously, without making direct use of it.
    
    Removing it is not simple: over the years various .c code learned to rely
    on this indirect inclusion.
    
    Remove the unnecessary include - this should speed up the kernel build a bit,
    as a large header is not included anymore in totally unrelated code.

    Revert "PCI, x86: Implement pcibios_alloc_irq() and pcibios_free_irq()"
    
    991de2e59090 ("PCI, x86: Implement pcibios_alloc_irq() and
    pcibios_free_irq()") appeared in v4.3 and helps support IOAPIC hotplug.
    
    Олег reported that the Elcus-1553 TA1-PCI driver worked in v4.2 but not
    v4.3 and bisected it to 991de2e59090.  Sunjin reported that the RocketRAID
    272x driver worked in v4.2 but not v4.3.  In both cases booting with
    "pci=routirq" is a workaround.
    
    I think the problem is that after 991de2e59090, we no longer call
    pcibios_enable_irq() for upstream bridges.  Prior to 991de2e59090, when a
    driver called pci_enable_device(), we recursively called
    pcibios_enable_irq() for upstream bridges via pci_enable_bridge().
    
    After 991de2e59090, we call pcibios_enable_irq() from pci_device_probe()
    instead of the pci_enable_device() path, which does *not* call
    pcibios_enable_irq() for upstream bridges.
    
    Revert 991de2e59090 to fix these driver regressions.

    introduced a regression in the PCI IRQ resource management by causing
    the IRQ resource of a device, established when pci_enabled_device()
    is called on a fully disabled device, to be released when the driver
    is unbound from the device, regardless of the enable_cnt.
    
    This leads to the situation that an ill-behaved driver can now make a
    device unusable to subsequent drivers by an imbalance in their use of
    pci_enable/disable_device().  That is a serious problem for secondary
    drivers like vfio-pci, which are innocent of the transgressions of
    the previous driver.
    
    Since the solution of this problem is not immediate and requires
    further discussion, revert commit b4b55cda5874 and the issue it was
    supposed to address (a bug related to xen-pciback) will be taken
    care of in a different way going forward.

    x86/PCI: Refine the way to release PCI IRQ resources
    
    Some PCI device drivers assume that pci_dev->irq won't change after
    calling pci_disable_device() and pci_enable_device() during suspend and
    resume.
    
    Commit c03b3b0738a5 ("x86, irq, mpparse: Release IOAPIC pin when
    PCI device is disabled") frees PCI IRQ resources when pci_disable_device()
    is called and reallocate IRQ resources when pci_enable_device() is
    called again. This breaks above assumption. So commit 3eec595235c1
    ("x86, irq, PCI: Keep IRQ assignment for PCI devices during
    suspend/hibernation") and 9eabc99a635a ("x86, irq, PCI: Keep IRQ
    assignment for runtime power management") fix the issue by avoiding
    freeing/reallocating IRQ resources during PCI device suspend/resume.
    They achieve this by checking dev.power.is_prepared and
    dev.power.runtime_status.  PM maintainer, Rafael, then pointed out that
    it's really an ugly fix which leaking PM internal state information to
    IRQ subsystem.
    
    Recently David Vrabel <david.vrabel@citrix.com> also reports an
    regression in pciback driver caused by commit cffe0a2b5a34 ("x86, irq:
    Keep balance of IOAPIC pin reference count"). Please refer to:
    http://lkml.org/lkml/2015/1/14/546
    
    So this patch refine the way to release PCI IRQ resources. Instead of
    releasing PCI IRQ resources in pci_disable_device()/
    pcibios_disable_device(), we now release it at driver unbinding
    notification BUS_NOTIFY_UNBOUND_DRIVER. In other word, we only release
    PCI IRQ resources when there's no driver bound to the PCI device, and
    it keeps the assumption that pci_dev->irq won't through multiple
    invocation of pci_enable_device()/pci_disable_device().

    x86: irq: Fix placement of mp_should_keep_irq()
    
    While f3761db164 ("x86, irq: Fix build error caused by
    9eabc99a635a77cbf09") addressed the original build problem,
    declaration, inline stub, and definition still seem misplaced: It isn't
    really IO-APIC related, and it's being used solely in arch/x86/pci/.
    This also means stubbing it out when !CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC was at least
    questionable.

    X86: drivers: remove __dev* attributes.
    
    CONFIG_HOTPLUG is going away as an option.  As a result, the __dev*
    markings need to be removed.
    
    This change removes the use of __devinit, __devexit_p, __devinitconst,
    and __devexit from these drivers.
    
    Based on patches originally written by Bill Pemberton, but redone by me
    in order to handle some of the coding style issues better, by hand.

    PCI: Pull PCI 'latency timer' setup up into the core
    
    The 'latency timer' of PCI devices, both Type 0 and Type 1,
    is setup in architecture-specific code [see: 'pcibios_set_master()'].
    There are two approaches being taken by all the architectures - check
    if the 'latency timer' is currently set between 16 and 255 and if not
    bring it within bounds, or, do nothing (and then there is the
    gratuitously different PA-RISC implementation).
    
    There is nothing architecture-specific about PCI's 'latency timer' so
    this patch pulls its setup functionality up into the PCI core by
    creating a generic 'pcibios_set_master()' function using the '__weak'
    attribute which can be used by all architectures as a default which,

    x86: constify PCI raw ops structures
    
    As with any other such change, the goal is to prevent inadvertent
    writes to these structures (assuming DEBUG_RODATA is enabled), and to
    separate data (possibly frequently) written to from such never getting
    modified.

commit 7bd1c365fd124624191d49dcc1eb9759d6017ec3
Author: Mike Habeck <habeck@sgi.com>
Date:   Wed May 12 11:14:32 2010 -0700

    x86/PCI: Add option to not assign BAR's if not already assigned
    
    The Linux kernel assigns BARs that a BIOS did not assign, most likely
    to handle broken BIOSes that didn't enumerate the devices correctly.
    On UV the BIOS purposely doesn't assign I/O BARs for certain devices/
    drivers we know don't use them (examples, LSI SAS, Qlogic FC, ...).
    We purposely don't assign these I/O BARs because I/O Space is a very
    limited resource.  There is only 64k of I/O Space, and in a PCIe
    topology that space gets divided up into 4k chucks (this is due to
    the fact that a pci-to-pci bridge's I/O decoder is aligned at 4k)...
    Thus a system can have at most 16 cards with I/O BARs: (64k / 4k = 16)
    
    SGI needs to scale to >16 devices with I/O BARs.  So by not assigning
    I/O BARs on devices we know don't use them, we can do that (iff the
    kernel doesn't go and assign these BARs that the BIOS purposely didn't
    assign).
    
    This patch will not assign a resource to a device BAR if that BAR was
    not assigned by the BIOS, and the kernel cmdline option 'pci=nobar'
    was specified.   This patch is closely modeled after the 'pci=norom'
    option that currently exists in the tree.

    x86/PCI: use host bridge _CRS info by default on 2008 and newer machines
    
    The main benefit of using ACPI host bridge window information is that
    we can do better resource allocation in systems with multiple host bridges,
    e.g., http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14183
    
    Sometimes we need _CRS information even if we only have one host bridge,
    e.g., https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/341681
    
    Most of these systems are relatively new, so this patch turns on
    "pci=use_crs" only on machines with a BIOS date of 2008 or newer.

    x86: Add pci_init_irq to x86_init
    
    Moorestown wants to reuse pcibios_init_irq but needs to provide its
    own implementation of pci_enable_irq. After we distangled the init we
    can move the init_irq call to x86_init and remove the pci_enable_irq
    != NULL check in pcibios_init_irq. pci_enable_irq is compile time
    initialized to pirq_enable_irq and the special cases which override it
    (visws and acpi) set the x86_init function pointer to noop. That
    allows MSRT to override pci_enable_irq and otherwise run
    pcibios_init_irq unmodified.

    x86: Move pci init function to x86_init
    
    The PCI initialization in pci_subsys_init() is a mess. pci_numaq_init,
    pci_acpi_init, pci_visws_init and pci_legacy_init are called and each
    implementation checks and eventually modifies the global variable
    pcibios_scanned.
    
    x86_init functions allow us to do this more elegant. The pci.init
    function pointer is preset to pci_legacy_init. numaq, acpi and visws
    can modify the pointer in their early setup functions. The functions
    return 0 when they did the full initialization including bus scan. A
    non zero return value indicates that pci_legacy_init needs to be
    called either because the selected function failed or wants the
    generic bus scan in pci_legacy_init to happen (e.g. visws).

    x86/PCI: MMCONFIG: add lookup function
    
    This patch factors out the search for an MMCONFIG region, which was
    previously implemented in both mmconfig_32 and mmconfig_64.  No functional
    change.

    This changes pci_mmcfg_region from a table to a list, to make it easier
    to add and remove MMCONFIG regions for PCI host bridge hotplug.

    x86/PCI: MMCONFIG: add virtual address to struct pci_mmcfg_region
    
    The virtual address is only used for x86_64, but it's so much simpler
    to manage it as part of the pci_mmcfg_region that I think it's worth
    wasting a pointer per MMCONFIG region on x86_32.

    x86/PCI: MMCONFIG: add resource to struct pci_mmcfg_region
    
    This patch adds a resource and corresponding name to the MMCONFIG
    structure.  This makes allocation simpler (we can allocate the
    resource and name at the same time we allocate the pci_mmcfg_region),
    and gives us a way to hang onto the resource after inserting it.
    This will be needed so we can release and free it when hot-removing
    a host bridge.

    x86/PCI: MMCONFIG: use a private structure rather than the ACPI MCFG one
    
    This adds a struct pci_mmcfg_region with a little more information
    than the struct acpi_mcfg_allocation used previously.  The acpi_mcfg
    structure is defined by the spec, so we can't change it.
    
    To begin with, struct pci_mmcfg_region is basically the same as the
    ACPI MCFG version, but future patches will add more information.

    Quoting from the commit message:
    
     "At this point, it seems to solve more problems than it causes, so let's
      try using it by default.  It's an easy revert if it ends up causing
      trouble."
    
    And guess what? The _CRS code causes trouble.

    Move

    to
    arch/x86/pci/mmconfig-shared.c: pci_parse_mcfg()
    where it is used, and make it static.
    
    Move associated globals and helper routine with it.
    
    No functional change.
    
    This code move is in preparation for SFI support,
    which will allow the PCI code to find the MCFG table
    on systems which do not support ACPI.

    Impact: cleanup
    
    Now that arch/x86/pci/pci.h is used in a number of other places as well,
    move the lowlevel x86 pci definitions into the architecture include files.
    (not to be confused with the existing arch/x86/include/asm/pci.h file,
    which provides public details about x86 PCI)
