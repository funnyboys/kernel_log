    x86, intel-mid: Cleanup some platform code's header files
    
    platform_ipc.h and platform_msic.h are wrongly declaring functions as
    external and with 'weak' attribute. This patch does a cleanup on those
    header files.
    
    It should have no functional change.

    intel_mid: Move platform device setups to their own platform_<device>.* files
    
    As Intel rolling out more SoC's after Moorestown, we need to
    re-structure the code in a way that is backward compatible and easy to
    expand. This patch implements a flexible way to support multiple boards
    and devices.
    
    This patch does not add any new functional support. It just refactors
    the existing code to increase the modularity and decrease the code
    duplication for supporting multiple soc's and boards.
    
    Currently intel-mid.c has both board and soc related code in one file.
    This patch moves the board related code to new files and let linker
    script to create SFI devite table following this:
    
    1. Move the SFI device specific code to
       arch/x86/platform/intel-mid/device-libs/platform_<device>.*
       A new device file is added for every supported device. This code will
       get conditionally compiled by using corresponding device driver
       CONFIG option.
    
    2. Move the device_ids location to .x86_intel_mid_dev.init section by
       using new sfi_device() macro.
    
    This patch was based on previous code from Sathyanarayanan Kuppuswamy.
