    mm: reorder includes after introduction of linux/pgtable.h
    
    The replacement of <asm/pgrable.h> with <linux/pgtable.h> made the include
    of the latter in the middle of asm includes.  Fix this up with the aid of
    the below script and manual adjustments here and there.
    
            import sys
            import re
    
            if len(sys.argv) is not 3:
                print "USAGE: %s <file> <header>" % (sys.argv[0])
                sys.exit(1)
    
            hdr_to_move="#include <linux/%s>" % sys.argv[2]
            moved = False
            in_hdrs = False
    
            with open(sys.argv[1], "r") as f:
                lines = f.readlines()
                for _line in lines:
                    line = _line.rstrip('
    ')
                    if line == hdr_to_move:
                        continue
                    if line.startswith("#include <linux/"):
                        in_hdrs = True
                    elif not moved and in_hdrs:
                        moved = True
                        print hdr_to_move
                    print line

commit 6f599d84231fd27e42f4ca2a786a6641e8cddf00
Author: Lianbo Jiang <lijiang@redhat.com>
Date:   Fri Nov 8 17:00:25 2019 +0800

    x86/kdump: Always reserve the low 1M when the crashkernel option is specified
    
    On x86, purgatory() copies the first 640K of memory to a backup region
    because the kernel needs those first 640K for the real mode trampoline
    during boot, among others.
    
    However, when SME is enabled, the kernel cannot properly copy the old
    memory to the backup area but reads only its encrypted contents. The
    result is that the crash tool gets invalid pointers when parsing vmcore:
    
      crash> kmem -s|grep -i invalid
      kmem: dma-kmalloc-512: slab:ffffd77680001c00 invalid freepointer:a6086ac099f0c5a4
      kmem: dma-kmalloc-512: slab:ffffd77680001c00 invalid freepointer:a6086ac099f0c5a4
      crash>
    
    So reserve the remaining low 1M memory when the crashkernel option is
    specified (after reserving real mode memory) so that allocated memory
    does not fall into the low 1M area and thus the copying of the contents
    of the first 640k to a backup region in purgatory() can be avoided
    altogether.
    
    This way, it does not need to be included in crash dumps or used for
    anything except the trampolines that must live in the low 1M.

    at boot "____ptrval____" is printed instead of the trampoline addresses:
    
      Base memory trampoline at [(____ptrval____)] 99000 size 24576
    
    Remove the print as we don't want to leak kernel addresses and this

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd
Author: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4

       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    x86/boot/realmode: Check for memory encryption on the APs
    
    Add support to check if memory encryption is active in the kernel and that
    it has been enabled on the AP. If memory encryption is active in the kernel
    but has not been enabled on the AP, then set the memory encryption bit (bit
    23) of MSR_K8_SYSCFG to enable memory encryption on that AP and allow the
    AP to continue start up.

    When Secure Memory Encryption is enabled, the trampoline area must not
    be encrypted. A CPU running in real mode will not be able to decrypt
    memory that has been encrypted because it will not be able to use addresses
    with the memory encryption mask.

    x86/boot: Rework reserve_real_mode() to allow multiple tries
    
    If reserve_real_mode() fails, panicing immediately means we're
    doomed.  Make it safe to try more than once to allocate the
    trampoline:
    
     - Degrade a failure from panic() to pr_info().  (If we make it to
       setup_real_mode() without reserving the trampoline, we'll panic
       them.)
    
     - Factor out helpers so that platform code can supply a specific
       address to try.
    
     - Warn if reserve_real_mode() is called after we're done with the
       memblock allocator.  If that were to happen, we would behave
       unpredictably.

    x86/boot: Defer setup_real_mode() to early_initcall time
    
    There's no need to run setup_real_mode() as early as we run it.
    Defer it to the same early_initcall that sets up the page
    permissions for the real mode code.
    
    This should be a code size reduction.  More importantly, it give us
    a longer window in which we can allocate the real mode trampoline.

    x86/boot: Synchronize trampoline_cr4_features and mmu_cr4_features directly
    
    The initialization process for trampoline_cr4_features and
    mmu_cr4_features was confusing.  The intent is for mmu_cr4_features
    and *trampoline_cr4_features to stay in sync, but
    trampoline_cr4_features is NULL until setup_real_mode() runs.  The
    old code synchronized *trampoline_cr4_features *twice*, once in
    setup_real_mode() and once in setup_arch().  It also initialized
    mmu_cr4_features in setup_real_mode(), which causes the actual value
    of mmu_cr4_features to potentially depend on when setup_real_mode()
    is called.
    
    With this patch, mmu_cr4_features is initialized directly in
    setup_arch(), and *trampoline_cr4_features is synchronized to
    mmu_cr4_features when the trampoline is set up.
    
    After this patch, it should be safe to defer setup_real_mode().

    x86/mm: Separate variable for trampoline PGD
    
    Use a separate global variable to define the trampoline PGD used to
    start other processors. This change will allow KALSR memory
    randomization to change the trampoline PGD to be correctly aligned with
    physical memory.

    x86: Store a per-cpu shadow copy of CR4
    
    Context switches and TLB flushes can change individual bits of CR4.
    CR4 reads take several cycles, so store a shadow copy of CR4 in a
    per-cpu variable.
    
    To avoid wasting a cache line, I added the CR4 shadow to
    cpu_tlbstate, which is already touched in switch_mm.  The heaviest
    users of the cr4 shadow will be switch_mm and __switch_to_xtra, and
    __switch_to_xtra is called shortly after switch_mm during context
    switch, so the cacheline is likely to be hot.

    x86, realmode: Pointer walk cleanups, pull out invariant use of __pa()
    
    The pointer arithmetic in this function was really bizarre, where in
    fact all we really wanted was a simple pointer array walk.  Use the
    much more idiomatic construction for that (*ptr++).
    
    Factor an invariant use of __pa() out of the relocation loop.  At
    least on 64 bits it seems gcc isn't capable of doing that
    automatically.
    
    Change the scope of a couple of variables to make it extra obvious
    that they are extremely local temp variables.

    x86, realmode: Set real_mode permissions early
    
    Trampoline code is executed by APs with kernel low mapping on 64bit.
    We need to set trampoline code to EXEC early before we boot APs.
    
    Found the problem after switching to #PF handler set page table,
    and we do not set initial kernel low mapping with EXEC anymore in
    arch/x86/kernel/head_64.S.
    
    Change to use early_initcall instead that will make sure trampoline
    will have EXEC set.

    x86: Use __pa_symbol instead of __pa on C visible symbols
    
    When I made an attempt at separating __pa_symbol and __pa I found that there
    were a number of cases where __pa was used on an obvious symbol.
    
    I also caught one non-obvious case as _brk_start and _brk_end are based on the
    address of __brk_base which is a C visible symbol.
    
    In mark_rodata_ro I was able to reduce the overhead of kernel symbol to
    virtual memory translation by using a combination of __va(__pa_symbol())
    instead of page_address(virt_to_page()).

commit 137127018812ec7fcccb9843156cfc0b5cfa31d5
Author: H. Peter Anvin <hpa@linux.intel.com>
Date:   Wed May 16 13:49:10 2012 -0700

    x86, realmode: Move kernel/realmode.c to realmode/init.c
    
    Keep all the realmode code together, including initialization (only
    the rm/ subdirectory is actually built as real-mode code, anyway.)
