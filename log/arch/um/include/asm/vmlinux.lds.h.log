    Construct init thread stack in the linker script rather than by union
    
    Construct the init thread stack in the linker script rather than doing it
    by means of a union so that ia64's init_task.c can be got rid of.
    
    The following symbols are then made available from INIT_TASK_DATA() linker
    script macro:
    
            init_thread_union
            init_stack
    
    INIT_TASK_DATA() also expands the region to THREAD_SIZE to accommodate the
    size of the init stack.  init_thread_union is given its own section so that
    it can be placed into the stack space in the right order.  I'm assuming
    that the ia64 ordering is correct and that the task_struct is first and the
    thread_info second.
