    [PATCH] uml: fix missing KBUILD_BASENAME
    
    2.6.15-mm1 caused kernel-offsets.c to stop compiling with a syntax error in a
    header.  The problem was with KBUILD_BASENAME, which didn't get a definition
    with the by-hand compilation in the main UML Makefile.
    
    This was OK before since the expansion was syntactically the same as the
    KBUILD_BASENAME token.  With -mm1, the expansion is now a quote-delimited
    string, so there needs to be a definition of it.
    
    Since kernel-offsets.c is basically the same as other arches' asm-offsets.c,
    and those seem to build OK, this patch turns kernel-offsets.c into
    asm-offsets.c.  kernel-offsets.c is in arch/um/sys-$(SUBARCH), i.e.  sys-i386
    and sys-x86_64, while kbuild expects it to be in arch/um/kernel.
    kernel-offsets.c is moved to
    arch/um/include/sysdep-$(SUBARCH)/kernel-offsets.h, which is included by
    arch/um/kernel/asm-offsets.c.  With that, include/asm-um/asm-offsets.h is
    generated automatically.  kernel-offsets.h continues to exist because it needs
    to be accessible to userspace UML code, and include/asm-um isn't.  So, a
    symlink is made from arch/um/include/kernel-offsets.h to
    include/asm-um/asm-offsets.h.

    kbuild: um fix so it compile with generic asm-offsets.h support
    
    um has it own set of files for asm-offsets. So for now the
    gen-asm-offset macro is just duplicated in the um Makefile.
    
    This may well be the final solution since um is a bit special compared
    to other architectures - time will tell.
    
    Also added a dummy arch/um/kernel/asm-offsets.h file to keep kbuild happy.
