    KEYS: Add a system blacklist keyring
    
    Add the following:
    
     (1) A new system keyring that is used to store information about
         blacklisted certificates and signatures.
    
     (2) A new key type (called 'blacklist') that is used to store a
         blacklisted hash in its description as a hex string.  The key accepts
         no payload.
    
     (3) The ability to configure a list of blacklisted hashes into the kernel
         at build time.  This is done by setting
         CONFIG_SYSTEM_BLACKLIST_HASH_LIST to the filename of a list of hashes
         that are in the form:
    
            "<hash>", "<hash>", ..., "<hash>"
    
         where each <hash> is a hex string representation of the hash and must
         include all necessary leading zeros to pad the hash to the right size.
    
    The above are enabled with CONFIG_SYSTEM_BLACKLIST_KEYRING.
    
    Once the kernel is booted, the blacklist keyring can be listed:
    
            root@andromeda ~]# keyctl show %:.blacklist
            Keyring
             723359729 ---lswrv      0     0  keyring: .blacklist
             676257228 ---lswrv      0     0   \_ blacklist: 123412341234c55c1dcc601ab8e172917706aa32fb5eaf826813547fdf02dd46
    
    The blacklist cannot currently be modified by userspace, but it will be
    possible to load it, for example, from the UEFI blacklist database.
    
    A later commit will make it possible to load blacklisted asymmetric keys in
    here too.
