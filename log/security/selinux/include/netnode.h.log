    selinux: reduce the number of calls to synchronize_net() when flushing caches
    
    When flushing the AVC, such as during a policy load, the various
    network caches are also flushed, with each making a call to
    synchronize_net() which has shown to be expensive in some cases.
    This patch consolidates the network cache flushes into a single AVC
    callback which only calls synchronize_net() once for each AVC cache
    flush.

    My @hp.com will no longer be valid starting August 5, 2011 so an update is
    necessary.  My new email address is employer independent so we don't have
    to worry about doing this again any time soon.

    SELinux: Add a network node caching mechanism similar to the sel_netif_*() functions
    
    This patch adds a SELinux IP address/node SID caching mechanism similar to the
    sel_netif_*() functions.  The node SID queries in the SELinux hooks files are
    also modified to take advantage of this new functionality.  In addition, remove
    the address length information from the sk_buff parsing routines as it is
    redundant since we already have the address family.
