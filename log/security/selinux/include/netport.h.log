commit 615e51fdda6f274e94b1e905fcaf6111e0d9aa20
Author: Paul Moore <pmoore@redhat.com>
Date:   Thu Jun 26 14:33:56 2014 -0400

    selinux: reduce the number of calls to synchronize_net() when flushing caches
    
    When flushing the AVC, such as during a policy load, the various
    network caches are also flushed, with each making a call to
    synchronize_net() which has shown to be expensive in some cases.
    This patch consolidates the network cache flushes into a single AVC
    callback which only calls synchronize_net() once for each AVC cache
    flush.

    doc: Update the email address for Paul Moore in various source files
    
    My @hp.com will no longer be valid starting August 5, 2011 so an update is
    necessary.  My new email address is employer independent so we don't have
    to worry about doing this again any time soon.
