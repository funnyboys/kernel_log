    tools, perf: add and use optimized ring_buffer_{read_head, write_tail} helpers
    
    Currently, on x86-64, perf uses LFENCE and MFENCE (rmb() and mb(),
    respectively) when processing events from the perf ring buffer which
    is unnecessarily expensive as we can do more lightweight in particular
    given this is critical fast-path in perf.
    
    According to Peter rmb()/mb() were added back then via a94d342b9cb0
    ("tools/perf: Add required memory barriers") at a time where kernel
    still supported chips that needed it, but nowadays support for these
    has been ditched completely, therefore we can fix them up as well.
    
    While for x86-64, replacing rmb() and mb() with smp_*() variants would
    result in just a compiler barrier for the former and LOCK + ADD for
    the latter (__sync_synchronize() uses slower MFENCE by the way), Peter
    suggested we can use smp_{load_acquire,store_release}() instead for
    architectures where its implementation doesn't resolve in slower smp_mb().
    Thus, e.g. in x86-64 we would be able to avoid CPU barrier entirely due
    to TSO. For architectures where the latter needs to use smp_mb() e.g.
    on arm, we stick to cheaper smp_rmb() variant for fetching the head.
    
    This work adds helpers ring_buffer_read_head() and ring_buffer_write_tail()
    for tools infrastructure that either switches to smp_load_acquire() for
    architectures where it is cheaper or uses READ_ONCE() + smp_rmb() barrier
    for those where it's not in order to fetch the data_head from the perf
    control page, and it uses smp_store_release() to write the data_tail.
    Latter is smp_mb() + WRITE_ONCE() combination or a cheaper variant if
    architecture allows for it. Those that rely on smp_rmb() and smp_mb() can
    further improve performance in a follow up step by implementing the two
    under tools/arch/*/include/asm/barrier.h such that they don't have to
    fallback to rmb() and mb() in tools/include/asm/barrier.h.
    
    Switch perf to use ring_buffer_read_head() and ring_buffer_write_tail()
    so it can make use of the optimizations. Later, we convert libbpf as
    well to use the same helpers.
    
    Side note [0]: the topic has been raised of whether one could simply use
    the C11 gcc builtins [1] for the smp_load_acquire() and smp_store_release()
    instead:
    
      __atomic_load_n(ptr, __ATOMIC_ACQUIRE);
      __atomic_store_n(ptr, val, __ATOMIC_RELEASE);
    
    Kernel and (presumably) tooling shipped along with the kernel has a
    minimum requirement of being able to build with gcc-4.6 and the latter
    does not have C11 builtins. While generally the C11 memory models don't
    align with the kernel's, the C11 load-acquire and store-release alone
    /could/ suffice, however. Issue is that this is implementation dependent
    on how the load-acquire and store-release is done by the compiler and
    the mapping of supported compilers must align to be compatible with the
    kernel's implementation, and thus needs to be verified/tracked on a
    case by case basis whether they match (unless an architecture uses them
    also from kernel side). The implementations for smp_load_acquire() and
    smp_store_release() in this patch have been adapted from the kernel side
    ones to have a concrete and compatible mapping in place.

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.
