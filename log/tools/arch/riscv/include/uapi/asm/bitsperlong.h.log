commit d0df00e30e4bf9bc27ddbd092ad683ff6121b360

    tools uapi: fix RISC-V 64-bit support
    
    The BPF library is not built on 64-bit RISC-V, as the BPF feature is
    not detected. Looking more in details, feature/test-bpf.c fails to build
    with the following error:
    
    | In file included from /tmp/linux-4.19.12/tools/include/uapi/asm/bitsperlong.h:17,
    |                  from /tmp/linux-4.19.12/tools/include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h:2,
    |                  from /usr/include/riscv64-linux-gnu/asm/unistd.h:1,
    |                  from test-bpf.c:2:
    | /tmp/linux-4.19.12/tools/include/asm-generic/bitsperlong.h:14:2: error: #error Inconsistent word size. Check asm/bitsperlong.h
    |  #error Inconsistent word size. Check asm/bitsperlong.h
    |   ^~~~~
    
    The UAPI from the tools directory is missing RISC-V support, therefore
    bitsperlong.h from asm-generic is used, defaulting to 32 bits.
    
    Fix that by adding tools/arch/riscv/include/uapi/asm/bitsperlong.h as
    a copy of arch/riscv/include/uapi/asm/bitsperlong.h and by updating
    tools/include/uapi/asm/bitsperlong.h.
