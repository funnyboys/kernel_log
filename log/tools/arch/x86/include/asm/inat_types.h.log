    objtool: Move x86 insn decoder to a common location
    
    The kernel tree has three identical copies of the x86 instruction
    decoder.  Two of them are in the tools subdir.
    
    The tools subdir is supposed to be completely standalone and separate
    from the kernel.  So having at least one copy of the kernel decoder in
    the tools subdir is unavoidable.  However, we don't need *two* of them.
    
    Move objtool's copy of the decoder to a shared location, so that perf
    will also be able to use it.
