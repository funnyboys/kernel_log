commit 7b3f74f7e0601b2767aee7e188b1e3a912c082a2
Author: Krzysztof Opasiak <k.opasiak@samsung.com>
Date:   Tue Mar 8 21:49:05 2016 +0100

    usbip: tools: Add vudc backend to usbip tools
    
    Adds an equivalent of usbip_host_driver for the vudc. Most
    of the code is already shared, but this adds some vudc specific
    code for getting information about devices.
    
    Based on code created in cooperation with Open Operating Systems
    Student Society at University of Warsaw (O2S3@UW) consisting of:
