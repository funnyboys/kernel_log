commit 7fe2f6399a84760a9af8896ac152728250f82adb
Author: Dominik Brodowski <linux@dominikbrodowski.net>
Date:   Wed Mar 30 16:30:11 2011 +0200

    cpupowerutils - cpufrequtils extended with quite some features
    
    CPU power consumption vs performance tuning is no longer
    limited to CPU frequency switching anymore: deep sleep states,
    traditional dynamic frequency scaling and hidden turbo/boost
    frequencies are tied close together and depend on each other.
    The first two exist on different architectures like PPC, Itanium and
    ARM, the latter (so far) only on X86. On X86 the APU (CPU+GPU) will
    only run most efficiently if CPU and GPU has proper power management
    in place.
    
    Users and Developers want to have *one* tool to get an overview what
    their system supports and to monitor and debug CPU power management
    in detail. The tool should compile and work on as many architectures
    as possible.
    
    Once this tool stabilizes a bit, it is intended to replace the
    Intel-specific tools in tools/power/x86
