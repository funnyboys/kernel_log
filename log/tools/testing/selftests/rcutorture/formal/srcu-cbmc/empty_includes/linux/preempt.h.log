    rcutorture: Add CBMC-based formal verification for SRCU
    
    This commit creates a formal/srcu-cbmc directory containing scripts that
    pull SRCU in from the source code, filter it to remove things that CBMC
    cannot handle, and run a series of verifications on it.  This has a number
    of shortcomings:
    
    1.      It does not yet hook into the upper-level self-test Makefiles.
    2.      It tests only a single scenario, store buffering.
    3.      There is no gcc-based syntax-error prefiltering.
    
    Nevertheless, it does fully verify a piece of SRCU under a moderately
    weak memory model (PSO).
