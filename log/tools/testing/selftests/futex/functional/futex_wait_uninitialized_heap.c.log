    selftests: Add test plan API to kselftest.h and adjust callers
    
    The test plan for TAP needs to be declared immediately after the header.
    This adds the test plan API to kselftest.h and updates all callers to
    declare their expected test counts.

    selftests: futex: print testcase-name and PASS/FAIL/ERROR status
    
    Most of the tests under selftests follow a pattern for their results,
    which can then be parsed easily by other external tools easily. Though
    futex tests do print the test results very well, it doesn't really
    follow the general selftests pattern.
    
    This patch makes necessary changes to fix that.
    
    Output before this patch:
    futex_requeue_pi: Test requeue functionality
            Arguments: broadcast=0 locked=0 owner=0 timeout=0ns
    Result:  PASS
    
    Output after this patch:
    futex_requeue_pi: Test requeue functionality
            Arguments: broadcast=0 locked=0 owner=0 timeout=0ns
    selftests: futex-requeue-pi [PASS]

commit 2aa8470f02a9b9e6a410d1264fe6c8fa6c402eff
Author: Darren Hart <dvhart@linux.intel.com>

    selftests: Add futex functional tests
    
    The futextest testsuite [1] provides functional, stress, and
    performance tests for the various futex op codes. Those tests will be of
    more use to futex developers if they are included with the kernel
    source.
    
    Copy the core infrastructure and the functional tests into selftests,
    but adapt them for inclusion in the kernel:
    
    - Update the Makefile to include the run_tests target, remove reference
      to the performance and stress tests from the contributed sources.
    - Replace my dead IBM email address with my current Intel email address.
    - Remove the warrantee and write-to paragraphs from the license blurbs.
    - Remove the NAME section as the filename is easily determined. ;-)
    - Make the whitespace usage consistent in a couple of places.
    - Cleanup various CodingStyle violations.
    
    A future effort will explore moving the performance and stress tests
    into the kernel.
