    selftests/powerpc: Import Anton's memcpy / copy_tofrom_user tests
    
    Turn Anton's memcpy / copy_tofrom_user test into something that can
    live in tools/testing/selftests.
    
    It requires one turd in arch/powerpc/lib/memcpy_64.S, but it's pretty
    harmless IMHO.
    
    We are sailing very close to the wind with the feature macros. We define
    them to nothing, which currently means we get a few extra nops and
    include the unaligned calls.
