    selftests: Use consistent include paths for libbpf
    
    Fix all selftests to include libbpf header files with the bpf/ prefix, to
    be consistent with external users of the library. Also ensure that all
    includes of exported libbpf header files (those that are exported on 'make
    install' of the library) use bracketed includes instead of quoted.
    
    To not break the build, keep the old include path until everything has been
    changed to the new one; a subsequent patch will remove that.

    selftests: bpf: centre kernel bpf objects under new subdir "progs"
    
    At the moment, all kernel bpf objects are listed under BPF_OBJ_FILES.
    Listing them manually sometimes causing patch conflict when people are
    adding new testcases simultaneously.
    
    It is better to centre all the related source files under a subdir
    "progs", then auto-generate the object file list.
