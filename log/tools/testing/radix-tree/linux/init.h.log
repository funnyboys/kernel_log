    radix tree test suite: Reduce kernel.h
    
    Many of the definitions in the radix-tree kernel.h are redundant with
    others in tools/include, or are no longer used, such as panic().
    Move the definition of __init to init.h and in_interrupt() to preempt.h

    radix-tree: add test for radix_tree_locate_item()
    
    Add a unit test that provides coverage for the bug fixed in the commit
    entitled "radix-tree: rewrite radix_tree_locate_item fix" from Hugh
    Dickins.  I've verified that this test fails before his patch due to
    miscalculated 'index' values in __locate() in lib/radix-tree.c, and
    passes with his fix.
