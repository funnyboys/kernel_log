    radix tree test harness
    
    This code is mostly from Andrew Morton and Nick Piggin; tarball downloaded
    from http://ozlabs.org/~akpm/rtth.tar.gz with sha1sum
    0ce679db9ec047296b5d1ff7a1dfaa03a7bef1bd
    
    Some small modifications were necessary to the test harness to fix the
    build with the current Linux source code.
    
    I also made minor modifications to automatically test the radix-tree.c
    and radix-tree.h files that are in the current source tree, as opposed
    to a copied and slightly modified version.  I am sure more could be done
    to tidy up the harness, as well as adding more tests.
