commit f8d5d0cc145cc21bfc56ef807dc28102aebbf228

    xarray: Add definition of struct xarray
    
    This is a direct replacement for struct radix_tree_root.  Some of the
    struct members have changed name; convert those, and use a #define so
    that radix_tree users continue to work without change.
