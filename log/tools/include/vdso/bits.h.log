    tools headers: Synchronize linux/bits.h with the kernel sources
    
    To pick up the changes in these csets:
    
      295bcca84916 ("linux/bits.h: add compile time sanity check of GENMASK inputs")
      3945ff37d2f4 ("linux/bits.h: Extract common header for vDSO")
    
    To address this tools/perf build warning:
    
      Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/include/linux/bits.h' differs from latest version at 'include/linux/bits.h'
      diff -u tools/include/linux/bits.h include/linux/bits.h
    
    This clashes with usage of userspace's static_assert(), that, at least
    on glibc, is guarded by a ifnded/endif pair, do the same to our copy of
    build_bug.h and avoid that diff in check_headers.sh so that we continue
    checking for drifts with the kernel sources master copy.
    
    This will all be tested with the set of build containers that includes
    uCLibc, musl libc, lots of glibc versions in lots of distros and cross
    build environments.
    
    The tools/objtool, tools/bpf, etc were tested as well.
