    perf_counter tools: Share list.h with the kernel
    
    The copy we were using came from another copy I did for the dwarves
    (pahole) package, that came from the kernel years ago.
    
    The only function that is used by the perf tools and that isn't in the
    kernel is list_del_range, that I'm leaving in the perf tools only for
    now.
