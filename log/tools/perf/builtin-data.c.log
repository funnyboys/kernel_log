    perf debug: Remove needless include directives from debug.h
    
    All we need there is a forward declaration for 'union perf_event', so
    remove it from there and add missing header directives in places using
    things from this indirect include.

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd
Author: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    Following commits will add new option to 'perf data convert'. All options
    should be grouped into a structure and passed to low level converter
    (currently there's only one converter).

    Move the subcommand-related files from perf to a new library named
    libsubcmd.a.
    
    Since we're moving files anyway, go ahead and rename 'exec_cmd.*' to
    'exec-cmd.*' to be consistent with the naming of all the other files.

    perf data: Support using -f to override perf.data file ownership for 'convert'
    
    Enable perf data convert to use perf.data when it is not owned by
    current user or root.
    
    Example:
    
     # perf record ls
     # chown Yunlong.Song:Yunlong.Song perf.data
     # ls -al perf.data
     -rw------- 1 Yunlong.Song Yunlong.Song 28260 Apr  2 17:35 perf.data
     # id
     uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),64(pkcs11)
    
    Before this patch:
    
     # perf data convert --to-ctf=./ctf-data/
     File perf.data not owned by current user or root (use -f to override)
     # perf data convert --to-ctf=./ctf-data/ -f
       Error: unknown switch `f'
    
      usage: perf data convert [<options>]
    
         -v, --verbose         be more verbose
         -i, --input <file>    input file name
             --to-ctf ...      Convert to CTF format
    
    After this patch:
    
     # perf data convert --to-ctf=./ctf-data/
     File perf.data not owned by current user or root (use -f to override)
     # perf data convert --to-ctf=./ctf-data/ -f
     # ls ctf-data/
     metadata  perf_stream_0
    
    As shown above, the -f option really works now.

    perf tools: Add the bash completion for listing subsubcommands of perf data
    
    The bash completion does not support listing subsubcommands for 'perf
    data <TAB>', so fix it.
    
    Example:
    
    Before this patch:
    
     $ perf data <TAB>
     $
    
    As shown above, the subsubcommands of perf data does not come out.
    
    After this patch:
    
     $ perf data <TAB>
     convert
    
    As shown above, the subsubcommands of perf data can come out now.

    perf data: Fix sentinel setting for data_cmds array
    
    The recent new patch "perf tools: Add new 'perf data' command" (commit
    2245bf14 in acme's git repo perf/core) has caused a building error when
    compiling the source code of perf:
    
     cc1: warnings being treated as errors
     builtin-data.c:89: error: missing initializer
     builtin-data.c:89: error: (near initialization for ‘data_cmds[1].summary’)

     make[1]: *** [perf-in.o] Error 2
     make: *** [all] Error 2
    
    This patch fixes the building error above.

    perf data: Add perf data to CTF conversion support
    
    Adding 'perf data convert' to convert perf data file into different
    format. This patch adds support for CTF format conversion.
    
    To convert perf.data into CTF run:
      $ perf data convert --to-ctf=./ctf-data/
      [ perf data convert: Converted 'perf.data' into CTF data './ctf-data/' ]
      [ perf data convert: Converted and wrote 11.268 MB (100230 samples) ]
    
    The command will create CTF metadata out of perf.data file (or one
    specified via -i option) and then convert all sample events into single
    CTF stream.
    
    Each sample_type bit is translated into separated CTF event field apart
    from following exceptions:
    
      PERF_SAMPLE_RAW          - added in next patch
      PERF_SAMPLE_READ         - TODO
      PERF_SAMPLE_CALLCHAIN    - TODO
      PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK - TODO
      PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_USER    - TODO
      PERF_SAMPLE_STACK_USER   - TODO
    
      $ perf --debug=data-convert=2 data convert ...
    
    The converted CTF data could be analyzed by CTF tools, like babletrace
    or tracecompass [1].

    The following members to the ctf-environment were decided to be added to
    distinguish and specify perf CTF data:
    
      - domain
    
        It says "kernel" because it contains a kernel trace (not to be
        confused with a user space like lttng-ust does)
    
      - tracer_name
    
        It says perf. This can be used to distinguish between lttng and perf
        CTF based trace.
    
      - version
    
        The kernel version from stream. In addition to release, this is what
        it looks like on a Debian kernel:
    
          release = "3.14-1-amd64";
          version = "3.14.0";

    perf tools: Add new 'perf data' command
    
    Adding new 'perf data' command to provide operations over data files.
    
    The 'perf data convert' sub command is coming in following patch, but
    there's possibility for other useful commands like 'perf data ls' (to
    display perf data file in directory in ls style).
