    perf ui browser: Allow specifying message to show when no samples are available to display
    
    The 'perf top' tool will use that to avoid having a initial blank screen
    while collecting the minimum number of samples to sort and display.

    perf tools: Add missing headers, mostly stdlib.h
    
    Part of the erosion of util/util.h, that will lose its include stdlib.h,
    we need to add it to places where it is needed but was getting it
    indirectly.

    perf ui browser: Move the extra title lines from the hists browser
    
    This will be useful for the annotate browser as well, that wants to have
    extra title lines, i.e. the current ui_browser unconditionally reserves
    the first line for a browser title and the last one for status messages.
    
    But some browsers, like the buckets one (hists browser) needs extra
    lines to show headers, allowing it to be shown or not, press 'H' in
    'perf top' or 'perf report' to see this feature.
    
    So move that logic to the core ui_browser used by the hists_browser
    ('perf top' and 'perf report' main interface) so that it can be used by
    the annotate browser too.

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    perf annotate: Implement visual marker for macro fusion
    
    For marking fused instructions clearly this patch adds a line before the
    first instruction of pair and joins it with the arrow of the jump to its
    target.
    
    For example, when "je" is selected in annotate view, the line before
    cmpl is displayed and joins the arrow of "je".
    
           │   ┌──cmpl   $0x0,argp_program_version_hook
     81.93 │   ├──je     20
           │   │  lock   cmpxchg %esi,0x38a9a4(%rip)
           │   │↓ jne    29
           │   │↓ jmp    43
     11.47 │20:└─→cmpxch %esi,0x38a999(%rip)
    
    That means the cmpl+je is a fused instruction pair and they should be
    considered together.
    
    Changelog:
    
    v3: Use Arnaldo's fix to improve the arrow origin rendering.  To get the
        evsel->evlist->env->cpuid, save the evsel in annotate_browser.
    
    v2: new function "ins__is_fused" to check if the instructions are fused.

    perf ui browser: Optional horizontal scrolling key binding
    
    If the classes derived from ui_browser want to do some sort of
    horizontal scrolling, they have just to set ui_browser->columns to
    the number of columns available.
    
    Those columns can be the number of characters on the screen, if what is
    desired is to scroll character by character, or the number of columns in
    a spreadsheet like table.
    
    This is what the hist_browser will do, skipping ui_browser->horiz_scroll
    columns when rendering each of its lines.

Date:   Tue Jul 1 11:07:54 2014 -0300

    perf ui browser: Add ->rows to disambiguate from ->height
    
    The ui_browser->height is about the whole browser "window", including
    any header, status lines or any other space needed for some "Yes", "No",
    etc buttons a descendent browser, like hist_browser, may have.
    
    Since the navigation is done mostly on the ui_browser methods, it needs
    to know how many rows are on the screen, while details about what other
    components are, say, if a header (that may be composed of multiple
    lines, etc) is present.
    
    Besides this we'll need to add a ui_browser->refresh_dimensions() hook
    so that browsers like hist_browser can update ->rows in response to
    screen resizes, this will come in a follow up patch.
    
    This patch just adds ->rows and updates it when updating ->height, keeps
    using ->height for the only other widget that can come with ui_browser,
    the scrollbar, that goes on using all the height on the rightmost column
    in the screen, using ->rows for the keyboard navigation needs.

    perf tools: Remove dependency on libnewt
    
    Now that the map browser shares the input routine with the hists
    browser, there is no need for using any libnewt routine, so remove all
    traces except for honouring NO_NEWT=1 on the makefile command line as an
    indication that TUI support is not needed, in fact it just sets
    NO_SLANG=1.

    perf annotate browser: More clearly separate columns
    
    The first column (columns in the near future) are for the per line event
    overhead(s), that only appear when they are not zero.
    
    To clearly separate it, add back a solid vertical line, with just one
    colour, not influenced by the per line overheads.
    
    Then have the addr/offset column, then optionally the dynamic
    (static in the future) jump->target arrows, if 'j' enables it.
    
    Then the instructions.

    perf annotate browser: Initial loop detection
    
    Simple algorithm, just look for the next backward jump that points to
    before the cursor.
    
    Then draw an arrow connecting the jump to its target.
    
    Do this as you move the cursor, entering/exiting possible loops.
    
    Ex (graph chars replaced to avoid mail encoding woes):
    
    avc_has_perm_flags
        0.00 |         nopl   0x0(%rax)
        5.36 |+-> 68:  mov    (%rax),%rax
        5.15 ||        test   %rax,%rax
        0.00 ||      v je     130
        2.96 ||   74:  cmp    -0x20(%rax),%ebx

    ui browser: Add method to write graphical characters
    
    To save typing on the switch char set slang stuff.
    
    It also helps in removing more slang direct calls, wrapping them at the
    ui_browser level, where at some point I'll try to implement those in
    terms of GTK+.
