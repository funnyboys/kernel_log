    liblockdep: Wrap kernel/locking/lockdep.c to allow usage from userspace
    
    kernel/locking/lockdep.c deals with validating locking scenarios for
    various architectures supported by the kernel. There isn't
    anything kernel specific going on in lockdep, and when we
    compare userspace to other architectures that don't have to deal
    with irqs such as s390, they become all too similar.
    
    We wrap kernel/locking/lockdep.c and include/linux/lockdep.h with
    several headers which allow us to build and use lockdep from
    userspace. We don't touch the kernel code itself which means
    that any work done on lockdep in the kernel will automatically
    benefit userspace lockdep as well!
