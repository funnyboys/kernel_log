    treewide: Replace GPLv2 boilerplate/reference with SPDX - rule 26
    
    Based on 1 normalized pattern(s):
    
      gnupg is free software you can redistribute it and or modify it
      under the terms of the gnu general public license as published by
      the free software foundation either version 2 of the license or at
      your option any later version gnupg is distributed in the hope that
      it will be useful but without any warranty without even the implied
      warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose see
      the gnu general public license for more details you should have
      received a copy of the gnu general public license along with this
      program if not write to the free software foundation inc 59 temple
      place suite 330 boston ma 02111 1307 usa note this code is heavily
      based on the gnu mp library actually it s the same code with only
      minor changes in the way the data is stored this is to support the
      abstraction of an optional secure memory allocation which may be
      used to avoid revealing of sensitive data due to paging etc the gnu
      mp library itself is published under the lgpl however i decided to
      publish this code under the plain gpl
    
    extracted by the scancode license scanner the SPDX license identifier
    
      GPL-2.0-or-later
    
    has been chosen to replace the boilerplate/reference in 14 file(s).

    crypto: GnuPG based MPI lib - source files (part 1)
    
    Adds the multi-precision-integer maths library which was originally taken
    from GnuPG and ported to the kernel by (among others) David Howells.
    This version is taken from Fedora kernel 2.6.32-71.14.1.el6.
    The difference is that checkpatch reported errors and warnings have been fixed.
    
    This library is used to implemenet RSA digital signature verification
    used in IMA/EVM integrity protection subsystem.
    
    Due to patch size limitation, the patch is divided into 4 parts.
