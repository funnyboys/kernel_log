    lib/zlib: add s390 hardware support for kernel zlib_inflate
    
    Add decompression functions to zlib_dfltcc library.  Update zlib_inflate
    functions with the hooks for s390 hardware support and adjust workspace
    structures with extra parameter lists required for hardware inflate
    decompression.

commit bc22c17e12c130dc929218a95aa347e0f3fd05dc
Author: Alain Knaff <alain@knaff.lu>

    bzip2/lzma: library support for gzip, bzip2 and lzma decompression
    
    Impact: Replaces inflate.c with a wrapper around zlib_inflate; new library code
    
    This is the first part of the bzip2/lzma patch
    
    The bzip patch is based on an idea by Christian Ludwig, includes support for
    compressing the kernel with bzip2 or lzma rather than gzip. Both
    compressors give smaller sizes than gzip.  Lzma's decompresses faster
    than bzip2.
    
    It also supports ramdisks and initramfs' compressed using these two
    compressors.
    
    The functionality has been successfully used for a couple of years by
    the udpcast project
    
    This version applies to "tip" kernel 2.6.28
    
    This part contains:
    - changed inflate.c to accomodate rest of patch
    - implementation of bzip2 compression (not used at this stage yet)
    - implementation of lzma compression (not used at this stage yet)
    - Makefile routines to support bzip2 and lzma kernel compression

commit 4f3865fb57a04db7cca068fed1c15badc064a302
Author: Richard Purdie <rpurdie@rpsys.net>

    [PATCH] zlib_inflate: Upgrade library code to a recent version
    
    Upgrade the zlib_inflate implementation in the kernel from a patched
    version 1.1.3/4 to a patched 1.2.3.
    
    The code in the kernel is about seven years old and I noticed that the
    external zlib library's inflate performance was significantly faster (~50%)
    than the code in the kernel on ARM (and faster again on x86_32).
    
    For comparison the newer deflate code is 20% slower on ARM and 50% slower
    on x86_32 but gives an approx 1% compression ratio improvement.  I don't
    consider this to be an improvement for kernel use so have no plans to
    change the zlib_deflate code.
    
    Various changes have been made to the zlib code in the kernel, the most
    significant being the extra functions/flush option used by ppp_deflate.
    This update reimplements the features PPP needs to ensure it continues to
    work.
    
    This code has been tested on ARM under both JFFS2 (with zlib compression
    enabled) and ppp_deflate and on x86_32.  JFFS2 sees an approx.  10% real
    world file read speed improvement.
    
    This patch also removes ZLIB_VERSION as it no longer has a correct value.
    We don't need version checks anyway as the kernel's module handling will
    take care of that for us.  This removal is also more in keeping with the
    zlib author's wishes (http://www.zlib.net/zlib_faq.html#faq24) and I've
    added something to the zlib.h header to note its a modified version.
