    move libgcc.h to include/linux
    
    Introducing a new include/lib directory just for this file totally
    messes up tab completion for include/linux, which is highly annoying.
    
    Move it to include/linux where we have headers for all kinds of other
    lib/ code as well.

commit b35cd9884fa5d81c9d5e7f57c9d03264ae2bd835
Author: Palmer Dabbelt <palmer@dabbelt.com>

    lib: Add shared copies of some GCC library routines
    
    Many ports (m32r, microblaze, mips, parisc, score, and sparc) use
    functionally identical copies of various GCC library routine files,
    which came up as we were submitting the RISC-V port (which also uses
    some of these).
    
    This patch adds a new copy of these library routine files, which are
    functionally identical to the various other copies.  These are
    availiable via Kconfig as CONFIG_GENERIC_$ROUTINE, which currently isn't
    used anywhere.
