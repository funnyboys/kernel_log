    ASoC: multi-component - ASoC Multi-Component Support
    
    This patch extends the ASoC API to allow sound cards to have more than one
    CODEC and more than one platform DMA controller. This is achieved by dividing
    some current ASoC structures that contain both driver data and device data into
    structures that only either contain device data or driver data. i.e.
    
     struct snd_soc_codec    --->  struct snd_soc_codec (device data)
                              +->  struct snd_soc_codec_driver (driver data)
    
     struct snd_soc_platform --->  struct snd_soc_platform (device data)
                              +->  struct snd_soc_platform_driver (driver data)
    
     struct snd_soc_dai      --->  struct snd_soc_dai (device data)
                              +->  struct snd_soc_dai_driver (driver data)
    
     struct snd_soc_device   --->  deleted
    
    This now allows ASoC to be more tightly aligned with the Linux driver model and
    also means that every ASoC codec, platform and (platform) DAI is a kernel
    device. ASoC component private data is now stored as device private data.
    
    The ASoC sound card struct snd_soc_card has also been updated to store lists
    of it's components rather than a pointer to a codec and platform. The PCM
    runtime struct soc_pcm_runtime now has pointers to all its components.
    
    This patch adds DAPM support for ASoC multi-component and removes struct
    snd_soc_socdev from DAPM core. All DAPM calls are now made on a card, codec
    or runtime PCM level basis rather than using snd_soc_socdev.
    
    Other notable multi-component changes:-
    
     * Stream operations now de-reference less structures.
     * close_delayed work() now runs on a DAI basis rather than looping all DAIs
       in a card.
     * PM suspend()/resume() operations can now handle N CODECs and Platforms
       per sound card.
     * Added soc_bind_dai_link() to bind the component devices to the sound card.
     * Added soc_dai_link_probe() and soc_dai_link_remove() to probe and remove
       DAI link components.
     * sysfs entries can now be registered per component per card.
     * snd_soc_new_pcms() functionailty rolled into dai_link_probe().
     * snd_soc_register_codec() now does all the codec list and mutex init.
    
    This patch changes the probe() and remove() of the CODEC drivers as follows:-
    
     o Make CODEC driver a platform driver
     o Moved all struct snd_soc_codec list, mutex, etc initialiasation to core.
     o Removed all static codec pointers (drivers now support > 1 codec dev)
     o snd_soc_register_pcms() now done by core.
     o snd_soc_register_dai() folded into snd_soc_register_codec().
