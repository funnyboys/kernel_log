commit f2055e145f2975a75dace8e386fad9364828cdb4
Author: Peter Ujfalusi <peter.ujfalusi@ti.com>
Date:   Mon Dec 17 14:21:34 2018 +0200

    ASoC: ti: Merge davinci and omap directories
    
    Create new directory to contain all Texas Instruments specific DAI,
    platform and machine drivers instead of scattering them under davinci and
    omap directories.
    
    There is already inter dependency between the two directories becasue of
    McASP (on dra7x it is serviced by sDMA, not EDMA).
    
    With the upcoming AM654 we will need to introduce new platform driver for
    UDMA and it does not fit under davinci, nor under omap.
    
    With the move I have restructured the Kconfig to be more usable in the era
    of simple-sound-card:
    CPU DAIs can be selected individually and they will select the platform
    driver they can be served with.
    
    To avoid breakage, I have moved over deprecated Kconfig options so
    defconfig builds will work without regression.
