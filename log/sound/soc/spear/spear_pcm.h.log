    ASoC: SPEAr: remove custom DMA alloc compat function
    
    spear_pcm_request_chan() is almost identical to
    dmaengine_pcm_compat_request_channel(), with the exception that the
    latter:
    
    a) Assumes that the DAI DMA data is a struct snd_dmaengine_dai_dma_data
       pointer rather than some custom type.
    
    b) dma_data->filter_data rather than dma_data should be passed to
       snd_dmaengine_pcm_request_channel() as the filter data.
    
    Make minor changes to the SPEAr DAI drivers so that those two conditions
    are met. This allows removal of the custom .compat_request_channel().

    ASoC: SPEAr: get rid of spear-pcm-audio struct device
    
    Modify the SPEAr PCM driver so that it's a utility library that can be
    registered on each DAI, rather than a separate struct device. This is
    more in line with how many recent DT-converted platforms operate, and
    avoids the need for yet another struct device.
    
    This is also required as a pre-cursor to removing
    spear_pcm_request_chan().
