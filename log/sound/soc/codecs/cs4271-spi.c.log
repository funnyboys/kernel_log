    ASoC: cs4271: replace codec to component
    
    Now we can replace Codec to Component. Let's do it.

            .idle_bias_off = 0      ->      .idle_bias_on = 1
            .ignore_pmdown_time = 0 ->      .use_pmdown_time = 1
            -                       ->      .endianness = 1
            -                       ->      .non_legacy_dai_naming = 1

    spi: Drop owner assignment from spi_drivers
    
    An spi_driver does not need to set an owner, it will be populated by the
    driver core.

commit c973b8a7dc50ace86393f209b19aa7fd0bfaf66b
Author: Axel Lin <axel.lin@ingics.com>
Date:   Mon Oct 6 23:09:47 2014 +0800

    ASoC: cs4271: Split SPI and I2C code into different modules
    
    Currently the cs4271 driver depends on SND_SOC_I2C_AND_SPI.
    So the driver cannot be built as built-in if CONFIG_I2C=m.
    Split SPI and I2C code into different modules to avoid this issue.
