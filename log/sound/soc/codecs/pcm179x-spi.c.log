    ASoC: pcm179x: replace codec to component
    
    Now we can replace Codec to Component. Let's do it.

            .idle_bias_off = 0      ->      .idle_bias_on = 1
            .ignore_pmdown_time = 0 ->      .use_pmdown_time = 1
            -                       ->      .endianness = 1
            -                       ->      .non_legacy_dai_naming = 1

    ASoC: pcm179x: Split into core and SPI parts
    
    The pcm179x family supports both SPI and I2C for configuration. This
    patch splits the driver into core and SPI parts, in preparation for
    I2C support.
