commit 2880fc877971d6c14b0c76ac09744e3ff5b126d5
Author: Dylan Reid <dgreid@chromium.org>
Date:   Thu Nov 13 11:18:29 2014 -0800

    ASoC: add TI ts3a227e headset chip driver
    
    The TS3A227E is an autonomous audio accessory detection and
    configuration switch that detects 3-pole or 4-pole audio accessories
    and configures internal switches to route the signals accordingly.
    
    This chip also has built-in support for the new button standard
    described in the Android "Wired audio headset specification" v1.0.
    These buttons will be reported on the jack as buttons 0-3 mapped to
    KEY_MEDIA, KEY_VOLUMEUP, KEY_VOLUMEDOWN, and KEY_VOICE_COMMAND.
    
    This will be added as an aux_dev and have the jack passed in from the
    machine driver.
