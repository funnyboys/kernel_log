    ASoC: pcm179x: replace codec to component
    
    Now we can replace Codec to Component. Let's do it.

            .idle_bias_off = 0      ->      .idle_bias_on = 1

            -                       ->      .endianness = 1
            -                       ->      .non_legacy_dai_naming = 1

    ASoC: pcm179x: Support continuous rates
    
    According to the PCM179x data sheets sampling frequencies between 10
    kHz and 200 kHz are supported. Specify support in the driver.
    
    Tested with PCM1791A.

    ASoC: pcm179x: Split into core and SPI parts
    
    The pcm179x family supports both SPI and I2C for configuration. This
    patch splits the driver into core and SPI parts, in preparation for
    I2C support.

    pcm1792a is compatible with pcm1795 and pcm1796 so it's
    better to have them under the common name pcm179x
