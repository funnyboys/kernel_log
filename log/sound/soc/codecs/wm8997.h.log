commit 40843aea5a9bd2c3d7917d086e6d23cb02cc4b39
Author: Charles Keepax <ckeepax@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>
Date:   Mon Aug 12 23:46:55 2013 +0100

    ASoC: wm8997: Initial CODEC driver
    
    The wm8997 is a compact, high-performance audio hub CODEC with SLIMbus
    interfacing, for smartphones, tablets and other portable audio devices
    based on the Arizona platform.
    
    This patch adds the wm8997 CODEC driver.
    
    [Fixed some interface churn from bitrot due to the patch not going via
    the MFD tree as expected -- broonie]
