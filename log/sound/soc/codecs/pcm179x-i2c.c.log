    ASoC: pcm179x: replace codec to component
    
    Now we can replace Codec to Component. Let's do it.

            .idle_bias_off = 0      ->      .idle_bias_on = 1
            .ignore_pmdown_time = 0 ->      .use_pmdown_time = 1
            -                       ->      .endianness = 1
            -                       ->      .non_legacy_dai_naming = 1
