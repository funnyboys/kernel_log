    ASoC: ep93xx: get rid of ep93xx-pcm-audio struct device
    
    Modify the ep93xx PCM driver so that it's a utility library that can be
    registered on each DAI, rather than a separate struct device. This is
    more in line with how many recent DT-converted platforms operate, and
    avoids the need for yet another struct device.

commit 453807f3006757a5661c4000262d7d9284b5214c
Author: Lars-Peter Clausen <lars@metafoo.de>
Date:   Fri Mar 22 14:12:10 2013 +0100

    ASoC: ep93xx: Use ep93xx_dma_params instead of ep93xx_pcm_dma_params
    
    Currently the ep93xx_dma_params struct which is passed to the dmaengine driver
    is constructed at runtime from the ep93xx_pcm_dma_params that gets passed to the
    ep93xx PCM driver from one of the ep93xx DAI drivers. The ep93xx_pcm_dma_params
    struct is almost identical to the ep93xx_dma_params struct. The only missing
    field is the 'direction' field, which is computed at runtime in the PCM driver
    based on the current substream. Since we know in advance which
    ep93xx_pcm_dma_params struct is being used for which substream at compile time,
    we also already know which direction to use at compile time. So we can easily
    replace all instances of ep93xx_pcm_dma_params with their ep93xx_dma_params
    counterpart. This allows us to simplify the code in the ep93xx pcm driver quite
    a bit.

    ASoC: Rename ep93xx soc directory to cirrus
    
    This patch is to rename the directory "ep93xx" in "cirrus".
    Name more accurately reflects the manufacturer and allows to add
    drivers not only for architecture ep93xx in this directory.
    Patch not contain any functional changes.
