    ALSA: firewire: add const qualifier to identifiers for read-only symbols
    
    Drivers in ALSA firewire stack still includes some symbols which can be
    moved to a section for read-only symbols.

commit e15c282eff54aaf4c5ed72d492da7060d14f7be8

    ALSA: bebob: unify configurations for some models produced by Yamaha/Terratec
    
    The below models were developed with a cooperation by Yamaha and Terratec.
     - Yamaha GO 44/Terratec PHASE 24 FW
     - Yamaha GO 46/Terratec PHASE X24 FW
    
    They have the same configurations, thus it's better to unify corresponding
    codes.
    
    This commit merges them to reduce the amount of maintained codes.

    ALSA: bebob: rename file with vendor-dependent code so that it's for Yamaha/Terratec
    
    Once Yamaha and Terratec cooperated to develop some audio and music units
    on IEEE 1394 bus. On these models, the same embedded board is used, and
    similar configurations are also applied.
    
    This commit renames file for Yamaha's configuration so that it's for both
    of Yamaha and Terratec.
