    ALSA: seq: Fix leftovers at probe error path
    
    The sequencer core module doesn't call some destructors in the error
    path of the init code, which may leave some resources.
    
    This patch mainly fix these leaks by calling the destructors
    appropriately at alsa_seq_init().  Also the patch brings a few
    cleanups along with it, namely:
    
    - Expand the old "if ((err = xxx) < 0)" coding style
    - Get rid of empty seq_queue_init() and its caller
    - Change snd_seq_info_done() to void
    
    Last but not least, a couple of functions lose __exit annotation since
    they are called also in alsa_seq_init().
    
    No functional changes but minor code cleanups.

    ALSA: replace CONFIG_PROC_FS with CONFIG_SND_PROC_FS
    
    We may disable proc fs only for sound part, to reduce ALSA
    memory footprint. So add CONFIG_SND_PROC_FS and replace the
    old CONFIG_PROC_FSs in alsa code.
    
    With sound proc fs disabled, we can save about 9KB memory
    size on X86_64 platform.

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
