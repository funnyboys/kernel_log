    [ALSA] Fix conflicts between const and __devinitdata
    
    Marvin told with a depressed face,
      gcc doesn't like both __devinitdata and const in the same line.
    So, remove const from all over places now...

    [ALSA] ice1724 - Add support of Chaintech AV-710
    
    Documentation,ICE1724 driver
    Add the support of Chaintech AV-710 to ice1724 driver.
    The patch includes the WM-codec initialization fix by
    Jaanus Kivistik <jaanus@no.spam.ee>.
    
    Since both AV-710 and AMP Audio2000 have the same SSID, initialize
    WM codecs as default for both devices.  In case it breaks Audio2000,
    you can pass 'model=amp2000' option to avoid WM codec initialization.

commit 1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
