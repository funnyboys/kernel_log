    [ALSA] snd-emu10k1: Attenuate output volume to reduce distortion
    
    Modules: EMU10K1/EMU10K2 driver
    
                          on Audigy 2 ZS Notebook.
    
    Set the master volume to about 6 or 8% in alsamixer. This will
    attenuate the output enough for better sound quality.
    Note: Only stereo enabled at present.
    The distortion is caused by the output path after the DSP
    adding 12dB gain to the output while still in digital mode,
    resulting in wrap around distortion.
