    ALSA: ac97: add an ac97 bus
    
    AC97 is a bus for sound usage. It enables for a AC97 AC-Link to link one
    controller to 0 to 4 AC97 codecs.
    
    The goal of this new implementation is to implement a device/driver
    model for AC97, with an automatic scan of the bus and automatic
    discovery of AC97 codec devices.
