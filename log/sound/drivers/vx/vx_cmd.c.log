    ALSA: vx: More constifications
    
    Apply const prefix to every possible place: the static tables for DSP
    commands, the string tables, and register/offset tables.
    
    Just for minor optimization and no functional changes.

    [ALSA] Remove sound/driver.h
    
    This header file exists only for some hacks to adapt alsa-driver
    tree.  It's useless for building in the kernel.  Let's move a few
    lines in it to sound/core.h and remove it.
    With this patch, sound/driver.h isn't removed but has just a single
    compile warning to include it.  This should be really killed in
    future.

commit 1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
