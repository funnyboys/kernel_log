    ALSA: usb-audio: Add support for Presonus Studio 1810c
    
    This patch adds support for Presonus Studio 1810c, a usb interface
    that's UAC2 compliant with a few quirks and a few extra hw-specific
    controls. I've tested all 3 altsettings and the added switch
    controls and they work as expected.
    
    More infos on the card:

    Note that this work is based on packet inspection with
    usbmon. I just wanted to get this card to work for using
    it on our open-source radio station:
    https://github.com/UoC-Radio
    
    v2 address issues reported by Takashi:
    * Properly get/set enum type controls
    * Prevent race condition on switch_get/set
    * Various control naming changes
    * Various coding style fixes
    
    v3 improve readability of sample rate filtering
    and some other minor changes.
