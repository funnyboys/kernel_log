commit f4fa968950aef7efb98a0899bb0132405e2edaf1
Author: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>
Date:   Tue Apr 16 18:18:47 2019 +0200

    ALSA: core: Don't refer to snd_cards array directly
    
    The snd_cards[] array holds the card pointers that have been currently
    registered, and it's exported for the external modules that may need
    to refer a card object.  But accessing to this array can be racy
    against the driver probe or removal, as the card registration or free
    may happen concurrently.
    
    This patch gets rid of the direct access to snd_cards[] array and
    provides a helper function to give the card object from the index
    number with a refcount management.  Then the caller can access to the
    given card object safely, and releases it via snd_card_unref().
    
    While we're at it, add a proper comment to snd_card_unref() and make
    it an inlined function for type-safety, too.

    ALSA: Remove the last mention of SNDRV_MAIN_OBJECT_FILE
    
    SNDRV_MAIN_OBJECT_FILE hasn't done anything since the pre-git days, and
    the only remaining reference occurs as a #define in sound/last.c.  Drop
    that last mention of it.

    ALSA: workaround: change the timing of alsa_sound_last_init()
    
    Current alsa_sound_last_init() was called as __initcall().
    So, on current ALSA, only devices that had been properly
    registered at this point were shown.
    So, it will show "No soundcards found" if driver requests
    probe deferment. it's often misleading.
    This patch delays the timing of alsa_sound_last_init()
    as workaround.

    [ALSA] Remove sound/driver.h
    
    This header file exists only for some hacks to adapt alsa-driver
    tree.  It's useless for building in the kernel.  Let's move a few
    lines in it to sound/core.h and remove it.
    With this patch, sound/driver.h isn't removed but has just a single
    compile warning to include it.  This should be really killed in
    future.

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
