    dtc: import latest upstream dtc
    
    This updates scripts/dtc to commit 317a5d9 "dtc: zero out new label
    objects" from git://git.jdl.com/software/dtc.git.
    
    This adds features such as:
    * /bits/ syntax for cell data.
    * Math expressions within cell data.
    * The ability to delete properties or nodes.
    * Support for #line directives in the input file, which allows the use of
      cpp on *.dts.
    * -i command-line option (/include/ path)
    * -W/-E command-line options for error/warning control.
    * Removal of spew to STDOUT containing the filename being compiled.
    * Many additions to the libfdt API.
