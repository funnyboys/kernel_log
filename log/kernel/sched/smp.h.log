commit 1f8db4150536431b031585ecc2a6793f69245de2

    sched/headers: Split out open-coded prototypes into kernel/sched/smp.h
    
    Move the prototypes for sched_ttwu_pending() and send_call_function_single_ipi()
    into the newly created kernel/sched/smp.h header, to make sure they are all
    the same, and to architectures happy that use -Wmissing-prototypes.
