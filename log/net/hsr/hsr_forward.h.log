    net/hsr: Better frame dispatch
    
    This patch removes the separate paths for frames coming from the outside, and
    frames sent from the HSR device, and instead makes all frames go through
    hsr_forward_skb() in hsr_forward.c. This greatly improves code readability and
    also opens up the possibility for future support of the HSR Interlink device
    that is the basis for HSR RedBoxes and HSR QuadBoxes, as well as VLAN
    compatibility.
    
    Other improvements:
    * A reduction in the number of times an skb is copied on machines without
      HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS, which improves throughput somewhat.
    * Headers are now created using the standard eth_header(), and using the
      standard hard_header_len.
    * Each HSR slave now gets its own private skb, so slave-specific fields can be
      correctly set.
