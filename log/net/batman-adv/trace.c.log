    batman-adv: Improve includes for trace functionality
    
    The batadv_dbg trace event uses different functionality and datastructures
    which are not directly associated with the trace infrastructure. It should
    not be expected that the trace headers indirectly provide them and instead
    include the required headers directly.

commit d331a739949992043b135fcfba649196b397ec3b
Author: Sven Eckelmann <sven@narfation.org>

    batman-adv: Provide debug messages as trace events
    
    A private debug logging infrastructure is currently provided via
    $debug_fs/batman_adv/*/log when CONFIG_BATMAN_ADV_DEBUG is enabled. This is
    not well integrated in the rest of the tracing infrastructure of the
    kernel.
    
    Other components (like mac80211 or ath10k) allow to gather the debug
    messages using generic trace events which are better integrated. This makes
    it possible to interact with them using the existing userspace tools.
    
    The tracepoint batadv:batadv_dbg will now be available when
    CONFIG_BATMAN_ADV_DEBUG and CONFIG_BATMAN_ADV_TRACING is activated. The log
    level mask is still used for filtering as usual.
    
    A full system trace for offline parsing can be created (and read) using:
    
      $ batctl ll all
      $ trace-cmd record -e batadv:batadv_dbg
      $ trace-cmd report
    
    The same can also be done without recording to a file
    
      $ batctl ll all
      $ trace-cmd stream -e batadv:batadv_dbg
    
    The trace infrastructure is especially helpful when tracing processes:
    
      $ batctl ll all
      $ ./tools/perf/perf trace --event "batadv:*" batctl p 10.204.32.1
