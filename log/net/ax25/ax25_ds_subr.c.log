    hlist: drop the node parameter from iterators
    
    I'm not sure why, but the hlist for each entry iterators were conceived
    
            list_for_each_entry(pos, head, member)
    
    The hlist ones were greedy and wanted an extra parameter:
    
            hlist_for_each_entry(tpos, pos, head, member)
    
    Why did they need an extra pos parameter? I'm not quite sure. Not only
    they don't really need it, it also prevents the iterator from looking
    exactly like the list iterator, which is unfortunate.
    
    Besides the semantic patch, there was some manual work required:
    
     - Fix up the actual hlist iterators in linux/list.h
     - Fix up the declaration of other iterators based on the hlist ones.
     - A very small amount of places were using the 'node' parameter, this
     was modified to use 'obj->member' instead.
     - Coccinelle didn't handle the hlist_for_each_entry_safe iterator
     properly, so those had to be fixed up manually.
    
    The semantic patch which is mostly the work of Peter Senna Tschudin is here:

commit 5a0e3ad6af8660be21ca98a971cd00f331318c05
Author: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 24 17:04:11 2010 +0900

    include cleanup: Update gfp.h and slab.h includes to prepare for breaking implicit slab.h inclusion from percpu.h
    
    percpu.h is included by sched.h and module.h and thus ends up being
    included when building most .c files.  percpu.h includes slab.h which
    in turn includes gfp.h making everything defined by the two files
    universally available and complicating inclusion dependencies.
    
    percpu.h -> slab.h dependency is about to be removed.  Prepare for
    this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those
    headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion
    needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is
    used as the basis of conversion.
    
      http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py
    
    The script does the followings.
    
    * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that
      only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,
      gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.
    
    * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include
      blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms
      to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains
      core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -
      alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there
      doesn't seem to be any matching order.
    
    * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly
      because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out
      an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the
      file.
    
    The conversion was done in the following steps.
    
    1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly
       over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h
       and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400
       files.
    
    2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,
       some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or
       embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added
       inclusions to around 150 files.
    
    3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits
       from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.
    
    4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.
       e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab
       APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.
    
    5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically
       editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h
       files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h
       inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually
       wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each
       slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as
       necessary.
    
    6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.
    
    7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures
       were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my
       distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few
       more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things
       build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).
    
       * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.
       * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig
       * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig
       * ia64 SMP allmodconfig
       * s390 SMP allmodconfig
       * alpha SMP allmodconfig
       * um on x86_64 SMP allmodconfig
    
    8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as
       a separate patch and serve as bisection point.
    
    Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step
    6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch.
    If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch
    headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of
    the specific arch.

    For the common, open coded 'skb->nh.raw = skb->data' operation, so that we can
    later turn skb->nh.raw into a offset, reducing the size of struct sk_buff in
    64bit land while possibly keeping it as a pointer on 32bit.
    
    This one touches just the most simple case, next will handle the slightly more

    [PATCH] remove many unneeded #includes of sched.h
    
    After Al Viro (finally) succeeded in removing the sched.h #include in module.h
    recently, it makes sense again to remove other superfluous sched.h includes.
    There are quite a lot of files which include it but don't actually need
    anything defined in there.  Presumably these includes were once needed for
    macros that used to live in sched.h, but moved to other header files in the
    course of cleaning it up.
    
    To ease the pain, this time I did not fiddle with any header files and only
    removed #includes from .c-files, which tend to cause less trouble.
    
    Compile tested against 2.6.20-rc2 and 2.6.20-rc2-mm2 (with offsets) on alpha,
    arm, i386, ia64, mips, powerpc, and x86_64 with allnoconfig, defconfig,
    allmodconfig, and allyesconfig as well as a few randconfigs on x86_64 and all
    configs in arch/arm/configs on arm.  I also checked that no new warnings were
    introduced by the patch (actually, some warnings are removed that were emitted
    by unnecessarily included header files).

    [AX.25]: Optimize AX.25 socket list lock
    
    Right now all uses of the ax25_list_lock lock are _bh locks but knowing
    some code is only ever getting invoked from _bh context we can better.

    [AX25] Introduce ax25_type_trans
    
    Replacing the open coded equivalents and making ax25 look more like
    a linux network protocol, i.e. more similar to inet.

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
