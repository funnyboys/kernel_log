    mac80211: move struct aead_req off the stack
    
    Some crypto implementations (such as the generic CCM wrapper in crypto/)
    use scatterlists to map fields of private data in their struct aead_req.
    This means these data structures cannot live in the vmalloc area, which
    means that they cannot live on the stack (with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK.)
    
    This currently occurs only with the generic software implementation, but
    the private data and usage is implementation specific, so move the whole
    data structures off the stack into heap by allocating every time we need
    to use them.
    
    In addition, take care not to put any of our own stack allocations into
    scatterlists. This involves reserving some extra room when allocating the
    aead_request structures, and referring to those allocations in the scatter-
    lists (while copying the data from the stack before the crypto operation)

    mac80111: Add BIP-GMAC-128 and BIP-GMAC-256 ciphers
    
    This allows mac80211 to configure BIP-GMAC-128 and BIP-GMAC-256 to the
    driver and also use software-implementation within mac80211 when the
    driver does not support this with hardware accelaration.
