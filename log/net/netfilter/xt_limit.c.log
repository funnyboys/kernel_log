    netfilter: x_tables: fix pointer leaks to userspace
    
    Several netfilter matches and targets put kernel pointers into
    info objects, but don't set usersize in descriptors.
    This leads to kernel pointer leaks if a match/target is set
    and then read back to userspace.
    
    Properly set usersize for these matches/targets.
    
    Found with manual code inspection.

    In matches and targets that define a kernel-only tail to their
    xt_match and xt_target data structs, add a field .usersize that
    specifies up to where data is to be shared with userspace.
    
    Performed a search for comment "Used internally by the kernel" to find

    netfilter: add my copyright statements
    
    Add copyright statements to all netfilter files which have had significant
    changes done by myself in the past.
    
    Some notes:
    
    - nf_conntrack_ecache.c was incorrectly attributed to Rusty and Netfilter
      Core Team when it got split out of nf_conntrack_core.c. The copyrights
      even state a date which lies six years before it was written. It was
      written in 2005 by Harald and myself.
    
    - net/ipv{4,6}/netfilter.c, net/netfitler/nf_queue.c were missing copyright
      statements. I've added the copyright statement from net/netfilter/core.c,
      where this code originated
    
    - for nf_conntrack_proto_tcp.c I've also added Jozsef, since I didn't want
      it to give the wrong impression

commit 5a0e3ad6af8660be21ca98a971cd00f331318c05
Author: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 24 17:04:11 2010 +0900

    include cleanup: Update gfp.h and slab.h includes to prepare for breaking implicit slab.h inclusion from percpu.h
    
    percpu.h is included by sched.h and module.h and thus ends up being
    included when building most .c files.  percpu.h includes slab.h which
    in turn includes gfp.h making everything defined by the two files
    universally available and complicating inclusion dependencies.
    
    percpu.h -> slab.h dependency is about to be removed.  Prepare for
    this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those
    headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion
    needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is
    used as the basis of conversion.
    
      http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py
    
    The script does the followings.
    
    * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that
      only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,
      gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.
    
    * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include
      blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms
      to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains
      core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -
      alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there
      doesn't seem to be any matching order.
    
    * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly
      because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out
      an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the
      file.
    
    The conversion was done in the following steps.
    
    1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly
       over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h
       and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400
       files.
    
    2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,
       some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or
       embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added
       inclusions to around 150 files.
    
    3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits
       from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.
    
    4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.
       e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab
       APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.
    
    5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically
       editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h
       files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h
       inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually
       wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each
       slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as
       necessary.
    
    6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.
    
    7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures
       were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my
       distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few
       more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things
       build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).
    
       * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.
       * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig
       * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig
       * ia64 SMP allmodconfig
       * s390 SMP allmodconfig
       * alpha SMP allmodconfig

    8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as
       a separate patch and serve as bisection point.
    
    Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step
    6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch.
    If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch
    headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of
    the specific arch.

    netfilter: xtables: slightly better error reporting
    
    When extended status codes are available, such as ENOMEM on failed
    allocations, or subsequent functions (e.g. nf_ct_get_l3proto), passing
    them up to userspace seems like a good idea compared to just always
    EINVAL.

    netfilter: xtables: change xt_match.checkentry return type
    
    Restore function signatures from bool to int so that we can report
    memory allocation failures or similar using -ENOMEM rather than
    always having to pass -EINVAL back.
    
    This semantic patch may not be too precise (checking for functions
    that use xt_mtchk_param rather than functions referenced by
    xt_match.checkentry), but reviewed, it produced the intended result.

    netfilter: xtables: move extension arguments into compound structure (1/6)
    
    The function signatures for Xtables extensions have grown over time.
    It involves a lot of typing/replication, and also a bit of stack space
    even if they are not used. Realize an NFWS2008 idea and pack them into
    structs. The skb remains outside of the struct so gcc can continue to
    apply its optimizations.
    
    This patch does this for match extensions' match functions.
    
    A few ambiguities have also been addressed. The "offset" parameter for
    example has been renamed to "fragoff" (there are so many different
    offsets already) and "protoff" to "thoff" (there is more than just one
    protocol here, so clarify).

    netfilter: implement NFPROTO_UNSPEC as a wildcard for extensions
    
    When a match or target is looked up using xt_find_{match,target},
    Xtables will also search the NFPROTO_UNSPEC module list. This allows
    for protocol-independent extensions (like xt_time) to be reused from
    other components (e.g. arptables, ebtables).
    
    Extensions that take different codepaths depending on match->family
    or target->family of course cannot use NFPROTO_UNSPEC within the
    registration structure (e.g. xt_pkttype).

    [NETFILTER]: Rename init functions.
    
    Every netfilter module uses `init' for its module_init() function and
    `fini' or `cleanup' for its module_exit() function.
    
    Problem is, this creates uninformative initcall_debug output and makes
    ctags rather useless.
    
    So go through and rename them all to $(filename)_init and
    $(filename)_fini.

    [NETFILTER] x_tables: Abstraction layer for {ip,ip6,arp}_tables
    
    This monster-patch tries to do the best job for unifying the data
    structures and backend interfaces for the three evil clones ip_tables,
    ip6_tables and arp_tables.  In an ideal world we would never have
    allowed this kind of copy+paste programming... but well, our world
    isn't (yet?) ideal.
    
    o introduce a new x_tables module
    o {ip,arp,ip6}_tables depend on this x_tables module
    o registration functions for tables, matches and targets are only
      wrappers around x_tables provided functions
    o all matches/targets that are used from ip_tables and ip6_tables
      are now implemented as xt_FOOBAR.c files and provide module aliases
      to ipt_FOOBAR and ip6t_FOOBAR
    o header files for xt_matches are in include/linux/netfilter/,
      include/linux/netfilter_{ipv4,ipv6} contains compatibility wrappers
      around the xt_FOOBAR.h headers
    
    Based on this patchset we're going to further unify the code,
    gradually getting rid of all the layer 3 specific assumptions.
