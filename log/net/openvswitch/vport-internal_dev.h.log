commit ccb1352e76cff0524e7ccb2074826a092dd13016
Author: Jesse Gross <jesse@nicira.com>

    net: Add Open vSwitch kernel components.
    
    Open vSwitch is a multilayer Ethernet switch targeted at virtualized
    environments.  In addition to supporting a variety of features
    expected in a traditional hardware switch, it enables fine-grained
    programmatic extension and flow-based control of the network.
    This control is useful in a wide variety of applications but is
    particularly important in multi-server virtualization deployments,
    which are often characterized by highly dynamic endpoints and the need
    to maintain logical abstractions for multiple tenants.
    
    The Open vSwitch datapath provides an in-kernel fast path for packet
    forwarding.  It is complemented by a userspace daemon, ovs-vswitchd,
    which is able to accept configuration from a variety of sources and
    translate it into packet processing rules.
    
    See http://openvswitch.org for more information and userspace
    utilities.
