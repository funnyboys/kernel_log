    tipc: rename tipc_server to tipc_topsrv
    
    We rename struct tipc_server to struct tipc_topsrv. This reflect its now
    specialized role as topology server. Accoringly, we change or add function
    prefixes to make it clearer which functionality those belong to.
    
    There are no functional changes in this commit.
