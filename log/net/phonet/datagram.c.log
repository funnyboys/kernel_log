    net: Remove iocb argument from sendmsg and recvmsg
    
    After TIPC doesn't depend on iocb argument in its internal
    implementations of sendmsg() and recvmsg() hooks defined in proto
    structure, no any user is using iocb argument in them at all now.
    Then we can drop the redundant iocb argument completely from kinds of
    implementations of both sendmsg() and recvmsg() in the entire
    networking stack.

    net: Add and use skb_copy_datagram_msg() helper.
    
    This encapsulates all of the skb_copy_datagram_iovec() callers
    with call argument signature "skb, offset, msghdr->msg_iov, length".
    
    When we move to iov_iters in the networking, the iov_iter object will
    sit in the msghdr.
    
    Having a helper like this means there will be less places to touch
    during that transformation.
    
    Based upon descriptions and patch from Al Viro.

    This is a follow-up patch to f3d3342602f8bc ("net: rework recvmsg
    handler msg_name and msg_namelen logic").
    
    DECLARE_SOCKADDR validates that the structure we use for writing the
    name information to is not larger than the buffer which is reserved
    for msg->msg_name (which is 128 bytes). Also use DECLARE_SOCKADDR
    consistently in sendmsg code paths.

    inet: prevent leakage of uninitialized memory to user in recv syscalls
    
    Only update *addr_len when we actually fill in sockaddr, otherwise we
    can return uninitialized memory from the stack to the caller in the
    recvfrom, recvmmsg and recvmsg syscalls. Drop the the (addr_len == NULL)
    checks because we only get called with a valid addr_len pointer either
    from sock_common_recvmsg or inet_recvmsg.
    
    If a blocking read waits on a socket which is concurrently shut down we
    now return zero and set msg_msgnamelen to 0.

    Phonet: hook resource routing to userspace via ioctl()'s
    
    I wish we could use something cleaner, such as bind(). But that would
    not work since resource subscription is orthogonal/in addition to the
    normal object ID allocated via bind(). This is similar to multicasting
    which also uses ioctl()'s.

commit 5a0e3ad6af8660be21ca98a971cd00f331318c05
Author: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 24 17:04:11 2010 +0900

    include cleanup: Update gfp.h and slab.h includes to prepare for breaking implicit slab.h inclusion from percpu.h
    
    percpu.h is included by sched.h and module.h and thus ends up being
    included when building most .c files.  percpu.h includes slab.h which
    in turn includes gfp.h making everything defined by the two files
    universally available and complicating inclusion dependencies.
    
    percpu.h -> slab.h dependency is about to be removed.  Prepare for
    this change by updating users of gfp and slab facilities include those
    headers directly instead of assuming availability.  As this conversion
    needs to touch large number of source files, the following script is
    used as the basis of conversion.
    
      http://userweb.kernel.org/~tj/misc/slabh-sweep.py
    
    The script does the followings.
    
    * Scan files for gfp and slab usages and update includes such that
      only the necessary includes are there.  ie. if only gfp is used,
      gfp.h, if slab is used, slab.h.
    
    * When the script inserts a new include, it looks at the include
      blocks and try to put the new include such that its order conforms
      to its surrounding.  It's put in the include block which contains
      core kernel includes, in the same order that the rest are ordered -
      alphabetical, Christmas tree, rev-Xmas-tree or at the end if there
      doesn't seem to be any matching order.
    
    * If the script can't find a place to put a new include (mostly
      because the file doesn't have fitting include block), it prints out
      an error message indicating which .h file needs to be added to the
      file.
    
    The conversion was done in the following steps.
    
    1. The initial automatic conversion of all .c files updated slightly
       over 4000 files, deleting around 700 includes and adding ~480 gfp.h
       and ~3000 slab.h inclusions.  The script emitted errors for ~400
       files.
    
    2. Each error was manually checked.  Some didn't need the inclusion,
       some needed manual addition while adding it to implementation .h or
       embedding .c file was more appropriate for others.  This step added
       inclusions to around 150 files.
    
    3. The script was run again and the output was compared to the edits
       from #2 to make sure no file was left behind.
    
    4. Several build tests were done and a couple of problems were fixed.
       e.g. lib/decompress_*.c used malloc/free() wrappers around slab
       APIs requiring slab.h to be added manually.
    
    5. The script was run on all .h files but without automatically
       editing them as sprinkling gfp.h and slab.h inclusions around .h
       files could easily lead to inclusion dependency hell.  Most gfp.h
       inclusion directives were ignored as stuff from gfp.h was usually
       wildly available and often used in preprocessor macros.  Each
       slab.h inclusion directive was examined and added manually as
       necessary.
    
    6. percpu.h was updated not to include slab.h.
    
    7. Build test were done on the following configurations and failures
       were fixed.  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL was turned off for all tests (as my
       distributed build env didn't work with gcov compiles) and a few
       more options had to be turned off depending on archs to make things
       build (like ipr on powerpc/64 which failed due to missing writeq).
    
       * x86 and x86_64 UP and SMP allmodconfig and a custom test config.
       * powerpc and powerpc64 SMP allmodconfig
       * sparc and sparc64 SMP allmodconfig
       * ia64 SMP allmodconfig
       * s390 SMP allmodconfig
       * alpha SMP allmodconfig
       * um on x86_64 SMP allmodconfig
    
    8. percpu.h modifications were reverted so that it could be applied as
       a separate patch and serve as bisection point.
    
    Given the fact that I had only a couple of failures from tests on step
    6, I'm fairly confident about the coverage of this conversion patch.
    If there is a breakage, it's likely to be something in one of the arch
    headers which should be easily discoverable easily on most builds of
    the specific arch.

    net: sk_drops consolidation
    
    sock_queue_rcv_skb() can update sk_drops itself, removing need for
    callers to take care of it. This is more consistent since
    sock_queue_rcv_skb() also reads sk_drops when queueing a skb.
    
    This adds sk_drops managment to many protocols that not cared yet.
