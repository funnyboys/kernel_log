    xfs: Use the correct style for SPDX License Identifier
    
    This patch corrects the SPDX License Identifier style in header files
    related to XFS File System support. For C header files
    Documentation/process/license-rules.rst mandates C-like comments.
    (opposed to C source files where C++ style should be used).
    
    Changes made by using a script provided by Joe Perches here:
    https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/2/7/46.

    xfs: refactor remote attr value buffer invalidation
    
    Hoist the code that invalidates remote extended attribute value buffers
    into a separate helper function.  This prepares us for a memory
    corruption fix in the next patch.

    xfs: convert to SPDX license tags
    
    Remove the verbose license text from XFS files and replace them
    with SPDX tags. This does not change the license of any of the code,
    merely refers to the common, up-to-date license files in LICENSES/
    
    This change was mostly scripted. fs/xfs/Makefile and
    fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_fs.h were modified by hand, the rest were detected
    and modified by the following command:
    
    for f in `git grep -l "GNU General" fs/xfs/` ; do
            echo $f
            cat $f | awk -f hdr.awk > $f.new
            mv -f $f.new $f
    done
    
    And the hdr.awk script that did the modification (including
    detecting the difference between GPL-2.0 and GPL-2.0+ licenses)
    is as follows:
    
    $ cat hdr.awk
    BEGIN {
            hdr = 1.0
            tag = "GPL-2.0"
            str = ""
    }
    
    /^ \* This program is free software/ {
            hdr = 2.0;
            next
    }
    
    /any later version./ {
            tag = "GPL-2.0+"
            next
    }
    
    /^ \*\// {
            if (hdr > 0.0) {
                    print "// SPDX-License-Identifier: " tag
                    print str
                    print $0
                    str=""
                    hdr = 0.0
                    next
            }
            print $0
            next
    }
    
    /^ \* / {
            if (hdr > 1.0)
                    next
            if (hdr > 0.0) {
                    if (str != "")
                            str = str "\n"
                    str = str $0
                    next
            }
            print $0
            next
    }
