    xfs: refactor intent item RECOVERED flag into the log item
    
    Rename XFS_{EFI,BUI,RUI,CUI}_RECOVERED to XFS_LI_RECOVERED so that we
    track recovery status in the log item, then get rid of the now unused
    flags fields in each of those log item types.

    xfs: use transaction for intent recovery instead of raw dfops
    
    Log intent recovery is the last user of an external (on-stack)
    dfops. The pattern exists because the dfops is used to collect
    additional deferred operations queued during the whole recovery
    sequence. The dfops is finished with a new transaction after intent
    recovery completes.
    
    We already have a mechanism to create an empty, container-like
    transaction to support the scrub infrastructure. We can reuse that
    mechanism here to drop the final user of external dfops. This
    facilitates folding dfops state (i.e., dop_low) into the
    transaction, the elimination of now unused external dfops support
    and also eliminates the only caller of __xfs_defer_cancel().
    
    Replace the on-stack dfops with an empty transaction and pass it
    around to the various helpers that queue and finish deferred
    operations during intent recovery.

    xfs: convert to SPDX license tags
    
    Remove the verbose license text from XFS files and replace them
    with SPDX tags. This does not change the license of any of the code,
    merely refers to the common, up-to-date license files in LICENSES/
    
    This change was mostly scripted. fs/xfs/Makefile and
    fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_fs.h were modified by hand, the rest were detected
    and modified by the following command:
    
    for f in `git grep -l "GNU General" fs/xfs/` ; do
            echo $f
            cat $f | awk -f hdr.awk > $f.new
            mv -f $f.new $f
    done
    
    And the hdr.awk script that did the modification (including
    detecting the difference between GPL-2.0 and GPL-2.0+ licenses)
    is as follows:
    
    $ cat hdr.awk
    BEGIN {
            hdr = 1.0
            tag = "GPL-2.0"
            str = ""
    }
    
    /^ \* This program is free software/ {
            hdr = 2.0;
            next
    }
    
    /any later version./ {
            tag = "GPL-2.0+"
            next
    }
    
    /^ \*\// {
            if (hdr > 0.0) {

    xfs: log recovery should replay deferred ops in order
    
    As part of testing log recovery with dm_log_writes, Amir Goldstein
    discovered an error in the deferred ops recovery that lead to corruption
    of the filesystem metadata if a reflink+rmap filesystem happened to shut
    down midway through a CoW remap:
    
    "This is what happens [after failed log recovery]:
    
    "Phase 1 - find and verify superblock...
    "Phase 2 - using internal log
    "        - zero log...
    "        - scan filesystem freespace and inode maps...
    "        - found root inode chunk
    "Phase 3 - for each AG...
    "        - scan (but don't clear) agi unlinked lists...
    "        - process known inodes and perform inode discovery...
    "        - agno = 0
    "data fork in regular inode 134 claims CoW block 376
    "correcting nextents for inode 134
    "bad data fork in inode 134
    "would have cleared inode 134"
    
    Hou Tao dissected the log contents of exactly such a crash:
    
    "According to the implementation of xfs_defer_finish(), these ops should
    be completed in the following sequence:
    
    "Have been done:
    "(1) CUI: Oper (160)
    "(2) BUI: Oper (161)
    "(3) CUD: Oper (194), for CUI Oper (160)
    "(4) RUI A: Oper (197), free rmap [0x155, 2, -9]
    
    "Should be done:
    "(5) BUD: for BUI Oper (161)
    "(6) RUI B: add rmap [0x155, 2, 137]
    "(7) RUD: for RUI A
    "(8) RUD: for RUI B
    
    "Actually be done by xlog_recover_process_intents()
    "(5) BUD: for BUI Oper (161)
    "(6) RUI B: add rmap [0x155, 2, 137]
    "(7) RUD: for RUI B
    "(8) RUD: for RUI A
    
    "So the rmap entry [0x155, 2, -9] for COW should be freed firstly,
    then a new rmap entry [0x155, 2, 137] will be added. However, as we can see
    from the log record in post_mount.log (generated after umount) and the trace
    print, the new rmap entry [0x155, 2, 137] are added firstly, then the rmap
    entry [0x155, 2, -9] are freed."
    
    When reconstructing the internal log state from the log items found on
    disk, it's required that deferred ops replay in exactly the same order
    that they would have had the filesystem not gone down.  However,
    replaying unfinished deferred ops can create /more/ deferred ops.  These
    new deferred ops are finished in the wrong order.  This causes fs
    corruption and replay crashes, so let's create a single defer_ops to
    handle the subsequent ops created during replay, then use one single
    transaction at the end of log recovery to ensure that everything is
    replayed in the same order as they're supposed to be.

    xfs: create bmbt update intent log items
    
    Create bmbt update intent/done log items to record redo information in
    the log.  Because we roll transactions multiple times for reflink
    operations, we also have to track the status of the metadata updates
    that will be recorded in the post-roll transactions in case we crash
    before committing the final transaction.  This mechanism enables log
    recovery to finish what was already started.
