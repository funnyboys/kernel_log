    xfs: convert to SPDX license tags
    
    Remove the verbose license text from XFS files and replace them
    with SPDX tags. This does not change the license of any of the code,
    merely refers to the common, up-to-date license files in LICENSES/
    
    This change was mostly scripted. fs/xfs/Makefile and
    fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_fs.h were modified by hand, the rest were detected
    and modified by the following command:
    
    for f in `git grep -l "GNU General" fs/xfs/` ; do
            echo $f
            cat $f | awk -f hdr.awk > $f.new
            mv -f $f.new $f
    done
    
    And the hdr.awk script that did the modification (including
    detecting the difference between GPL-2.0 and GPL-2.0+ licenses)
    is as follows:
    
    $ cat hdr.awk
    BEGIN {
            hdr = 1.0
            tag = "GPL-2.0"
            str = ""
    }
    
    /^ \* This program is free software/ {
            hdr = 2.0;
            next
    }
    
    /any later version./ {
            tag = "GPL-2.0+"
            next
    }
    
    /^ \*\// {
            if (hdr > 0.0) {
                    print "// SPDX-License-Identifier: " tag
                    print str
                    print $0
                    str=""
                    hdr = 0.0
                    next
            }
            print $0
            next
    }
    
    /^ \* / {
            if (hdr > 1.0)
                    next
            if (hdr > 0.0) {
                    if (str != "")
                            str = str "\n"
                    str = str $0
                    next
            }
            print $0
            next
    }
    
    /^ \*/ {
            if (hdr > 0.0)
                    next
            print $0
            next
    }
    
    // {
            if (hdr > 0.0) {
                    if (str != "")
                            str = str "\n"
                    str = str $0
                    next
            }
            print $0
    }
    
    END { }

    xfs: create an ioctl to scrub AG metadata
    
    Create an ioctl that can be used to scrub internal filesystem metadata.
    The new ioctl takes the metadata type, an (optional) AG number, an
    (optional) inode number and generation, and a flags argument.  This will
    be used by the upcoming XFS online scrub tool.
