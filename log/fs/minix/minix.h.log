    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

commit a528d35e8bfcc521d7cb70aaf03e1bd296c8493f

    statx: Add a system call to make enhanced file info available
    
    Add a system call to make extended file information available, including
    file creation and some attribute flags where available through the
    underlying filesystem.
    
    The getattr inode operation is altered to take two additional arguments: a
    u32 request_mask and an unsigned int flags that indicate the
    synchronisation mode.  This change is propagated to the vfs_getattr*()
    function.
    
    Functions like vfs_stat() are now inline wrappers around new functions
    vfs_statx() and vfs_statx_fd() to reduce stack usage.
    
    ========
    OVERVIEW
    ========
    
    The idea was initially proposed as a set of xattrs that could be retrieved
    with getxattr(), but the general preference proved to be for a new syscall
    with an extended stat structure.
    
    A number of requests were gathered for features to be included.  The
    following have been included:
    
     (1) Make the fields a consistent size on all arches and make them large.
    
     (2) Spare space, request flags and information flags are provided for
         future expansion.
    
     (3) Better support for the y2038 problem [Arnd Bergmann] (tv_sec is an
         __s64).
    
     (4) Creation time: The SMB protocol carries the creation time, which could
         be exported by Samba, which will in turn help CIFS make use of
         FS-Cache as that can be used for coherency data (stx_btime).
    
         This is also specified in NFSv4 as a recommended attribute and could
         be exported by NFSD [Steve French].
    
     (5) Lightweight stat: Ask for just those details of interest, and allow a
         netfs (such as NFS) to approximate anything not of interest, possibly
         without going to the server [Trond Myklebust, Ulrich Drepper, Andreas
         Dilger] (AT_STATX_DONT_SYNC).
    
     (6) Heavyweight stat: Force a netfs to go to the server, even if it thinks
         its cached attributes are up to date [Trond Myklebust]
         (AT_STATX_FORCE_SYNC).
    
    And the following have been left out for future extension:
    
     (7) Data version number: Could be used by userspace NFS servers [Aneesh
         Kumar].
    
         Can also be used to modify fill_post_wcc() in NFSD which retrieves
         i_version directly, but has just called vfs_getattr().  It could get
         it from the kstat struct if it used vfs_xgetattr() instead.
    
         (There's disagreement on the exact semantics of a single field, since
         not all filesystems do this the same way).
    
     (8) BSD stat compatibility: Including more fields from the BSD stat such
         as creation time (st_btime) and inode generation number (st_gen)
         [Jeremy Allison, Bernd Schubert].
    
     (9) Inode generation number: Useful for FUSE and userspace NFS servers
         [Bernd Schubert].
    
         (This was asked for but later deemed unnecessary with the
         open-by-handle capability available and caused disagreement as to
         whether it's a security hole or not).
    
    (10) Extra coherency data may be useful in making backups [Andreas Dilger].
    
         (No particular data were offered, but things like last backup
         timestamp, the data version number and the DOS archive bit would come
         into this category).
    
    (11) Allow the filesystem to indicate what it can/cannot provide: A
         filesystem can now say it doesn't support a standard stat feature if
         that isn't available, so if, for instance, inode numbers or UIDs don't
         exist or are fabricated locally...
    
         (This requires a separate system call - I have an fsinfo() call idea
         for this).
    
    (12) Store a 16-byte volume ID in the superblock that can be returned in
         struct xstat [Steve French].
    
         (Deferred to fsinfo).
    
    (13) Include granularity fields in the time data to indicate the
         granularity of each of the times (NFSv4 time_delta) [Steve French].
    
         (Deferred to fsinfo).
    
    (14) FS_IOC_GETFLAGS value.  These could be translated to BSD's st_flags.
         Note that the Linux IOC flags are a mess and filesystems such as Ext4
         define flags that aren't in linux/fs.h, so translation in the kernel
         may be a necessity (or, possibly, we provide the filesystem type too).
    
         (Some attributes are made available in stx_attributes, but the general
         feeling was that the IOC flags were to ext[234]-specific and shouldn't
         be exposed through statx this way).
    
    (15) Mask of features available on file (eg: ACLs, seclabel) [Brad Boyer,
         Michael Kerrisk].
    
         (Deferred, probably to fsinfo.  Finding out if there's an ACL or
         seclabal might require extra filesystem operations).
    
    (16) Femtosecond-resolution timestamps [Dave Chinner].
    
         (A __reserved field has been left in the statx_timestamp struct for
         this - if there proves to be a need).
    
    (17) A set multiple attributes syscall to go with this.
    
    ===============
    NEW SYSTEM CALL
    ===============
    
    The new system call is:
    
            int ret = statx(int dfd,
                            const char *filename,
                            unsigned int flags,
                            unsigned int mask,
                            struct statx *buffer);
    
    The dfd, filename and flags parameters indicate the file to query, in a
    similar way to fstatat().  There is no equivalent of lstat() as that can be
    emulated with statx() by passing AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW in flags.  There is
    also no equivalent of fstat() as that can be emulated by passing a NULL
    filename to statx() with the fd of interest in dfd.
    
    Whether or not statx() synchronises the attributes with the backing store
    can be controlled by OR'ing a value into the flags argument (this typically
    only affects network filesystems):
    
     (1) AT_STATX_SYNC_AS_STAT tells statx() to behave as stat() does in this
         respect.
    
     (2) AT_STATX_FORCE_SYNC will require a network filesystem to synchronise
         its attributes with the server - which might require data writeback to
         occur to get the timestamps correct.
    
     (3) AT_STATX_DONT_SYNC will suppress synchronisation with the server in a
         network filesystem.  The resulting values should be considered
         approximate.
    
    mask is a bitmask indicating the fields in struct statx that are of
    interest to the caller.  The user should set this to STATX_BASIC_STATS to
    get the basic set returned by stat().  It should be noted that asking for
    more information may entail extra I/O operations.
    
    buffer points to the destination for the data.  This must be 256 bytes in
    size.
    
    ======================
    MAIN ATTRIBUTES RECORD
    ======================
    
    The following structures are defined in which to return the main attribute
    set:
    
            struct statx_timestamp {
                    __s64   tv_sec;
                    __s32   tv_nsec;
                    __s32   __reserved;
            };
    
            struct statx {
                    __u32   stx_mask;
                    __u32   stx_blksize;
                    __u64   stx_attributes;
                    __u32   stx_nlink;
                    __u32   stx_uid;
                    __u32   stx_gid;
                    __u16   stx_mode;
                    __u16   __spare0[1];
                    __u64   stx_ino;
                    __u64   stx_size;
                    __u64   stx_blocks;
                    __u64   __spare1[1];
                    struct statx_timestamp  stx_atime;
                    struct statx_timestamp  stx_btime;
                    struct statx_timestamp  stx_ctime;
                    struct statx_timestamp  stx_mtime;
                    __u32   stx_rdev_major;
                    __u32   stx_rdev_minor;
                    __u32   stx_dev_major;
                    __u32   stx_dev_minor;
                    __u64   __spare2[14];
            };
    
    The defined bits in request_mask and stx_mask are:
    
            STATX_TYPE              Want/got stx_mode & S_IFMT
            STATX_MODE              Want/got stx_mode & ~S_IFMT
            STATX_NLINK             Want/got stx_nlink
            STATX_UID               Want/got stx_uid
            STATX_GID               Want/got stx_gid
            STATX_ATIME             Want/got stx_atime{,_ns}
            STATX_MTIME             Want/got stx_mtime{,_ns}
            STATX_CTIME             Want/got stx_ctime{,_ns}
            STATX_INO               Want/got stx_ino
            STATX_SIZE              Want/got stx_size
            STATX_BLOCKS            Want/got stx_blocks
            STATX_BASIC_STATS       [The stuff in the normal stat struct]
            STATX_BTIME             Want/got stx_btime{,_ns}
            STATX_ALL               [All currently available stuff]
    
    stx_btime is the file creation time, stx_mask is a bitmask indicating the
    data provided and __spares*[] are where as-yet undefined fields can be
    placed.
    
    Time fields are structures with separate seconds and nanoseconds fields
    plus a reserved field in case we want to add even finer resolution.  Note
    that times will be negative if before 1970; in such a case, the nanosecond
    fields will also be negative if not zero.
    
    The bits defined in the stx_attributes field convey information about a
    file, how it is accessed, where it is and what it does.  The following
    attributes map to FS_*_FL flags and are the same numerical value:
    
            STATX_ATTR_COMPRESSED           File is compressed by the fs
            STATX_ATTR_IMMUTABLE            File is marked immutable
            STATX_ATTR_APPEND               File is append-only
            STATX_ATTR_NODUMP               File is not to be dumped
            STATX_ATTR_ENCRYPTED            File requires key to decrypt in fs
    
    Within the kernel, the supported flags are listed by:
    
            KSTAT_ATTR_FS_IOC_FLAGS
    
    [Are any other IOC flags of sufficient general interest to be exposed
    through this interface?]
    
    New flags include:
    
            STATX_ATTR_AUTOMOUNT            Object is an automount trigger
    
    These are for the use of GUI tools that might want to mark files specially,
    depending on what they are.
    
    Fields in struct statx come in a number of classes:
    
     (0) stx_dev_*, stx_blksize.
    
         These are local system information and are always available.
    
     (1) stx_mode, stx_nlinks, stx_uid, stx_gid, stx_[amc]time, stx_ino,
         stx_size, stx_blocks.
    
         These will be returned whether the caller asks for them or not.  The
         corresponding bits in stx_mask will be set to indicate whether they
         actually have valid values.
    
         If the caller didn't ask for them, then they may be approximated.  For
         example, NFS won't waste any time updating them from the server,
         unless as a byproduct of updating something requested.
    
         If the values don't actually exist for the underlying object (such as
         UID or GID on a DOS file), then the bit won't be set in the stx_mask,
         even if the caller asked for the value.  In such a case, the returned
         value will be a fabrication.
    
         Note that there are instances where the type might not be valid, for
         instance Windows reparse points.
    
     (2) stx_rdev_*.
    
         This will be set only if stx_mode indicates we're looking at a
         blockdev or a chardev, otherwise will be 0.
    
     (3) stx_btime.
    
         Similar to (1), except this will be set to 0 if it doesn't exist.
    
    =======
    TESTING
    =======
    
    The following test program can be used to test the statx system call:
    
            samples/statx/test-statx.c
    
    Just compile and run, passing it paths to the files you want to examine.
    The file is built automatically if CONFIG_SAMPLES is enabled.
    
    Here's some example output.  Firstly, an NFS directory that crosses to
    another FSID.  Note that the AUTOMOUNT attribute is set because transiting
    this directory will cause d_automount to be invoked by the VFS.
    
            [root@andromeda ~]# /tmp/test-statx -A /warthog/data
            statx(/warthog/data) = 0
            results=7ff

    fs: cleanup slight list_entry abuse
    
    list_entry is just a wrapper for container_of, but it is arguably
    wrong (and slightly confusing) to use it when the pointed-to struct
    member is not a struct list_head. Use container_of directly instead.

    fs/minix: Verify bitmap block counts before mounting
    
    Newer versions of MINIX can create filesystems that allocate an extra
    bitmap block.  Mounting of this succeeds, but doing a statfs call will
    result in an oops in count_free because of a negative number being used
    for the bh index.
    
    Avoid this by verifying the number of allocated blocks at mount time,
    erroring out if there are not enough and make statfs ignore the extras
    if there are too many.
    
    This fixes https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18792

    bitops: remove minix bitops from asm/bitops.h
    
    minix bit operations are only used by minix filesystem and useless by
    other modules.  Because byte order of inode and block bitmaps is different
    on each architecture like below:
    
    m68k:
            big-endian 16bit indexed bitmaps
    
    h8300, microblaze, s390, sparc, m68knommu:
            big-endian 32 or 64bit indexed bitmaps
    
    m32r, mips, sh, xtensa:
            big-endian 32 or 64bit indexed bitmaps for big-endian mode
            little-endian bitmaps for little-endian mode
    
    Others:
            little-endian bitmaps
    
    In order to move minix bit operations from asm/bitops.h to architecture
    independent code in minix filesystem, this provides two config options.
    
    CONFIG_MINIX_FS_BIG_ENDIAN_16BIT_INDEXED is only selected by m68k.
    CONFIG_MINIX_FS_NATIVE_ENDIAN is selected by the architectures which use
    native byte order bitmaps (h8300, microblaze, s390, sparc, m68knommu,
    m32r, mips, sh, xtensa).  The architectures which always use little-endian
    bitmaps do not select these options.
    
    Finally, we can remove minix bit operations from asm/bitops.h for all
    architectures.

    clean up write_begin usage for directories in pagecache
    
    For filesystem that implement directories in pagecache we call
    block_write_begin with an already allocated page for this code, while the
    normal regular file write path uses the default block_write_begin behaviour.
    
    Get rid of the __foofs_write_begin helper and opencode the normal write_begin
    call in foofs_write_begin, while adding a new foofs_prepare_chunk helper for
    the directory code.  The added benefit is that foofs_prepare_chunk has
    a much saner calling convention.
    
    Note that the interruptible flag passed into block_write_begin is always
    ignored if we already pass in a page (see next patch for details), and
    we never were doing truncations of exessive blocks for this case either so we
    can switch directly to block_write_begin_newtrunc.

    Making fs/minix/minix.h double including safe
    
    I happened to find that fs/minix/minix.h doesn't guard double include.
    
    Yes, I know this never cause something destructive because this is
    self-evidence that no source file includes minix.h twice, but I think
    fixing this is better than disregarding it.

    minix: remove !NO_TRUNCATE code
    
    This patch removes the !NO_TRUNCATE code that anyway required a manual
    editing of the code for being used.

    iget: stop the MINIX filesystem from using iget() and read_inode()
    
    Stop the MINIX filesystem from using iget() and read_inode().  Replace
    minix_read_inode() with minix_iget(), and call that instead of iget().
    minix_iget() then uses iget_locked() directly and returns a proper error code
    instead of an inode in the event of an error.
    
    minix_fill_super() returns any error incurred when getting the root inode
    instead of EINVAL.

    [PATCH] mark struct inode_operations const 2
    
    Many struct inode_operations in the kernel can be "const".  Marking them const
    moves these to the .rodata section, which avoids false sharing with potential
    dirty data.  In addition it'll catch accidental writes at compile time to
    these shared resources.

    [PATCH] Minix V3 support
    
    This morning I needed to read a Minix V3 filesystem, but unfortunately my
    2.6.19 did not support that, and neither did the downloaded 2.6.20rc4.
    
    Fortunately, google told me that Daniel Aragones had already done the work,
    patch found at http://www.terra.es/personal2/danarag/
    
    Unfortunaly, looking at the patch was painful to my eyes, so I polished it
    a bit before applying.  The resulting kernel boots, and reads the
    filesystem it needed to read.

    [PATCH] Make most file operations structs in fs/ const
    
    This is a conversion to make the various file_operations structs in fs/
    const.  Basically a regexp job, with a few manual fixups
    
    The goal is both to increase correctness (harder to accidentally write to
    shared datastructures) and reducing the false sharing of cachelines with
    things that get dirty in .data (while .rodata is nicely read only and thus
    cache clean)

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
