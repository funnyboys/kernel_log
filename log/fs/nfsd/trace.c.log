    nfsd: move include of state.h from trace.c to trace.h
    
    Any file which includes trace.h will need to include state.h, even if
    they aren't using any state tracepoints. Ensure that we include any
    headers that might be needed in trace.h instead of relying on the
    *.c files to have the right ones.

    nfsd: add trace events
    
    For now just a few simple events to trace the layout stateid lifetime, but
    these already were enough to find several bugs in the Linux client layout
    stateid handling.
