    JFS: call io_schedule() instead of schedule() to avoid deadlock
    
    The introduction of Jens Axboe's explicit i/o plugging patches introduced a
    deadlock in jfs.  This was caused by the process initiating I/O not
    unplugging the queue before waiting on the commit thread.  The commit
    thread itself was waiting for that I/O to complete.  Calling io_schedule()
    rather than schedule() unplugs the I/O queue avoiding the deadlock, and it
    appears to be the right function to call in any case.

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
