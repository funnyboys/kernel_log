commit b40c2e665cd552eae5fbdbb878bc29a34357668e
Author: Tino Reichardt <milky-kernel@mcmilk.de>

    fs/jfs: TRIM support for JFS Filesystem
    
    This patch adds support for the two linux interfaces of the discard/TRIM
    command for SSD devices and sparse/thinly-provisioned LUNs.
    
    JFS will support batched discard via FITRIM ioctl and online discard
    with the discard mount option.
