commit 96de0e252cedffad61b3cb5e05662c591898e69a
Author: Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@gmx.de>
Date:   Fri Oct 19 23:21:04 2007 +0200

    Convert files to UTF-8 and some cleanups
    
    * Convert files to UTF-8.
    
      * Also correct some people's names
        (one example is EiÃŸfeldt, which was found in a source file.
        Given that the author used an ÃŸ at all in a source file
        indicates that the real name has in fact a 'ÃŸ' and not an 'ss',
        which is commonly used as a substitute for 'ÃŸ' when limited to
        7bit.)
    
      * Correct town names (Goettingen -> GÃ¶ttingen)
    
      * Update Eberhard MÃ¶nkeberg's address (http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/8/313)

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
