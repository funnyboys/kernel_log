commit 7909f2bf835376a20d6dbf853eb459a27566eba2
Author: Tao Ma <tao.ma@oracle.com>
Date:   Tue Dec 18 15:47:25 2007 +0800

    [PATCH 2/2] ocfs2: Implement group add for online resize
    
    This patch adds the ability for a userspace program to request that a
    properly formatted cluster group be added to the main allocation bitmap for
    an Ocfs2 file system. The request is made via an ioctl, OCFS2_IOC_GROUP_ADD.
    On a high level, this is similar to ext3, but we use a different ioctl as
    the structure which has to be passed through is different.
    
    During an online resize, tunefs.ocfs2 will format any new cluster groups
    which must be added to complete the resize, and call OCFS2_IOC_GROUP_ADD on
    each one. Kernel verifies that the core cluster group information is valid
    and then does the work of linking it into the global allocation bitmap.

    [PATCH 1/2] ocfs2: Add group extend for online resize
    
    This patch adds the ability for a userspace program to request an extend of
    last cluster group on an Ocfs2 file system. The request is made via ioctl,
    OCFS2_IOC_GROUP_EXTEND. This is derived from EXT3_IOC_GROUP_EXTEND, but is
    obviously Ocfs2 specific.
    
    tunefs.ocfs2 would call this for an online-resize operation if the last
    cluster group isn't full.
