Author: Sunil Mushran <sunil.mushran@oracle.com>

    ocfs2/dlm: Add message DLM_QUERY_REGION
    
    Adds new dlm message DLM_QUERY_REGION that sends the names of all active
    heartbeat regions. This message is only sent in the global heartbeat
    mode. If the regions in the joining node do not fully match the ones in
    the active nodes, the join domain request is rejected.
