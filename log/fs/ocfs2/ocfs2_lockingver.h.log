    ocfs2_dlmfs: Enable the use of user cluster stacks.
    
    Unlike ocfs2, dlmfs has no permanent storage.  It can't store off a
    cluster stack it is supposed to be using.  So it can't specify the stack
    name in ocfs2_cluster_connect().
    
    Instead, we create ocfs2_cluster_connect_agnostic(), which simply uses
    the stack that is currently enabled.  This is find for dlmfs, which will
    rely on the stack initialization.
    
    We add the "stackglue" capability to dlmfs's capability list.  This lets
    userspace know dlmfs can be used with all cluster stacks.

    ocfs2: Negotiate locking protocol versions.
    
    Currently, when ocfs2 nodes connect via TCP, they advertise their
    compatibility level.  If the versions do not match, two nodes cannot speak
    to each other and they disconnect. As a result, this provides no forward or
    backwards compatibility.
    
    This patch implements a simple protocol negotiation at the dlm level by
    introducing a major/minor version number scheme for entities that
    communicate.  Specifically, o2dlm has a major/minor version for interaction
    with o2dlm on other nodes, and ocfs2 itself has a major/minor version for
    interacting with the filesystem on other nodes.
    
    This will allow rolling upgrades of ocfs2 clusters when changes to the
    locking or network protocols can be done in a backwards compatible manner.
    In those cases, only the minor number is changed and the negotatied protocol
    minor is returned from dlm join. In the far less likely event that a
    required protocol change makes backwards compatibility impossible, we simply
    bump the major number.
