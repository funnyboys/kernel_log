commit 6714d8e86bf443f6f7af50f9d432025649f091f5
Author: Kurt Hackel <kurt.hackel@oracle.com>
Date:   Thu Dec 15 14:31:23 2005 -0800

    [PATCH] OCFS2: The Second Oracle Cluster Filesystem
    
    A distributed lock manager built with the cluster file system use case
    in mind. The OCFS2 dlm exposes a VMS style API, though things have
    been simplified internally. The only lock levels implemented currently
    are NLMODE, PRMODE and EXMODE.
