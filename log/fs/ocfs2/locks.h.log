commit 53da4939f349d4edd283b043219221ca5b78e4d4

    ocfs2: POSIX file locks support
    
    This is actually pretty easy since fs/dlm already handles the bulk of the
    work. The Ocfs2 userspace cluster stack module already uses fs/dlm as the
    underlying lock manager, so I only had to add the right calls.
    
    Cluster-aware POSIX locks ("plocks") can be turned off by the same means at
    UNIX locks - mount with 'noflocks', or create a local-only Ocfs2 volume.
    Internally, the file system uses two sets of file_operations, depending on
    whether cluster aware plocks is required. This turns out to be easier than
    implementing local-only versions of ->lock.

    [PATCH 2/2] ocfs2: cluster aware flock()
    
    Hook up ocfs2_flock(), using the new flock lock type in dlmglue.c. A new
    mount option, "localflocks" is added so that users can revert to old
    functionality as need be.
