commit 6038f373a3dc1f1c26496e60b6c40b164716f07e
Author: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>

    llseek: automatically add .llseek fop
    
    All file_operations should get a .llseek operation so we can make
    nonseekable_open the default for future file operations without a
    .llseek pointer.
    
    The three cases that we can automatically detect are no_llseek, seq_lseek
    and default_llseek. For cases where we can we can automatically prove that
    the file offset is always ignored, we use noop_llseek, which maintains
    the current behavior of not returning an error from a seek.
    
    New drivers should normally not use noop_llseek but instead use no_llseek
    and call nonseekable_open at open time.  Existing drivers can be converted
    to do the same when the maintainer knows for certain that no user code
    relies on calling seek on the device file.
    
    The generated code is often incorrectly indented and right now contains
    comments that clarify for each added line why a specific variant was
    chosen. In the version that gets submitted upstream, the comments will
    be gone and I will manually fix the indentation, because there does not
    seem to be a way to do that using coccinelle.
    
    Some amount of new code is currently sitting in linux-next that should get
    the same modifications, which I will do at the end of the merge window.
    
    Many thanks to Julia Lawall for helping me learn to write a semantic
    patch that does all this.

commit 9361401eb7619c033e2394e4f9f6d410d6719ac7

    [PATCH] BLOCK: Make it possible to disable the block layer [try #6]
    
    Make it possible to disable the block layer.  Not all embedded devices require
    it, some can make do with just JFFS2, NFS, ramfs, etc - none of which require
    the block layer to be present.
    
    This patch does the following:
    
     (*) Introduces CONFIG_BLOCK to disable the block layer, buffering and blockdev
         support.
    
     (*) Adds dependencies on CONFIG_BLOCK to any configuration item that controls
         an item that uses the block layer.  This includes:
    
         (*) Block I/O tracing.
    
         (*) Disk partition code.
    
         (*) All filesystems that are block based, eg: Ext3, ReiserFS, ISOFS.
    
         (*) The SCSI layer.  As far as I can tell, even SCSI chardevs use the
             block layer to do scheduling.  Some drivers that use SCSI facilities -
             such as USB storage - end up disabled indirectly from this.
    
         (*) Various block-based device drivers, such as IDE and the old CDROM
             drivers.
    
         (*) MTD blockdev handling and FTL.
    
         (*) JFFS - which uses set_bdev_super(), something it could avoid doing by
             taking a leaf out of JFFS2's book.
    
     (*) Makes most of the contents of linux/blkdev.h, linux/buffer_head.h and
         linux/elevator.h contingent on CONFIG_BLOCK being set.  sector_div() is,
         however, still used in places, and so is still available.
    
     (*) Also made contingent are the contents of linux/mpage.h, linux/genhd.h and
         parts of linux/fs.h.
    
     (*) Makes a number of files in fs/ contingent on CONFIG_BLOCK.
    
     (*) Makes mm/bounce.c (bounce buffering) contingent on CONFIG_BLOCK.
    
     (*) set_page_dirty() doesn't call __set_page_dirty_buffers() if CONFIG_BLOCK
         is not enabled.
    
     (*) fs/no-block.c is created to hold out-of-line stubs and things that are
         required when CONFIG_BLOCK is not set:
    
         (*) Default blockdev file operations (to give error ENODEV on opening).
    
     (*) Makes some /proc changes:
    
         (*) /proc/devices does not list any blockdevs.
    
         (*) /proc/diskstats and /proc/partitions are contingent on CONFIG_BLOCK.
    
     (*) Makes some compat ioctl handling contingent on CONFIG_BLOCK.
    
     (*) If CONFIG_BLOCK is not defined, makes sys_quotactl() return -ENODEV if
         given command other than Q_SYNC or if a special device is specified.
    
     (*) In init/do_mounts.c, no reference is made to the blockdev routines if
         CONFIG_BLOCK is not defined.  This does not prohibit NFS roots or JFFS2.
    
     (*) The bdflush, ioprio_set and ioprio_get syscalls can now be absent (return
         error ENOSYS by way of cond_syscall if so).
    
     (*) The seclvl_bd_claim() and seclvl_bd_release() security calls do nothing if
         CONFIG_BLOCK is not set, since they can't then happen.
