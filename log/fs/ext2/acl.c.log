    ext2: cache NULL when both default_acl and acl are NULL
    
    default_acl and acl of newly created inode will be initiated as
    ACL_NOT_CACHED in vfs function inode_init_always() and later will be
    updated by calling xxx_init_acl() in specific filesystems.  However,
    when default_acl and acl are NULL, then they keep the value of
    ACL_NOT_CACHED. This patch changes the code to cache NULL for acl /
    default_acl in this case to save unnecessary ACL lookup in future.

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    ext2: preserve i_mode if ext2_set_acl() fails
    
    When changing a file's acl mask, ext2_set_acl() will first set the group
    bits of i_mode to the value of the mask, and only then set the actual
    extended attribute representing the new acl.
    
    If the second part fails (due to lack of space, for example) and the file
    had no acl attribute to begin with, the system will from now on assume
    that the mask permission bits are actual group permission bits, potentially
    granting access to the wrong users.
    
    Prevent this by only changing the inode mode after the acl has been set.

    ext2: Don't clear SGID when inheriting ACLs
    
    When new directory 'DIR1' is created in a directory 'DIR0' with SGID bit
    set, DIR1 is expected to have SGID bit set (and owning group equal to
    the owning group of 'DIR0'). However when 'DIR0' also has some default
    ACLs that 'DIR1' inherits, setting these ACLs will result in SGID bit on
    'DIR1' to get cleared if user is not member of the owning group.
    
    Fix the problem by creating __ext2_set_acl() function that does not call
    posix_acl_update_mode() and use it when inheriting ACLs. That prevents
    SGID bit clearing and the mode has been properly set by
    posix_acl_create() anyway.

    fs: Replace CURRENT_TIME_SEC with current_time() for inode timestamps
    
    CURRENT_TIME_SEC is not y2038 safe. current_time() will
    be transitioned to use 64 bit time along with vfs in a
    separate patch.
    There is no plan to transistion CURRENT_TIME_SEC to use
    y2038 safe time interfaces.
    
    current_time() will also be extended to use superblock
    range checking parameters when range checking is introduced.
    
    This works because alloc_super() fills in the the s_time_gran
    in super block to NSEC_PER_SEC.

    posix_acl: Clear SGID bit when setting file permissions
    
    When file permissions are modified via chmod(2) and the user is not in
    the owning group or capable of CAP_FSETID, the setgid bit is cleared in
    inode_change_ok().  Setting a POSIX ACL via setxattr(2) sets the file
    permissions as well as the new ACL, but doesn't clear the setgid bit in
    a similar way; this allows to bypass the check in chmod(2).  Fix that.

    posix_acl: Inode acl caching fixes
    
    When get_acl() is called for an inode whose ACL is not cached yet, the
    get_acl inode operation is called to fetch the ACL from the filesystem.
    The inode operation is responsible for updating the cached acl with
    set_cached_acl().  This is done without locking at the VFS level, so
    another task can call set_cached_acl() or forget_cached_acl() before the
    get_acl inode operation gets to calling set_cached_acl(), and then
    get_acl's call to set_cached_acl() results in caching an outdate ACL.
    
    Prevent this from happening by setting the cached ACL pointer to a
    task-specific sentinel value before calling the get_acl inode operation.
    Move the responsibility for updating the cached ACL from the get_acl
    inode operations to get_acl().  There, only set the cached ACL if the
    sentinel value hasn't changed.
    
    The sentinel values are chosen to have odd values.  Likewise, the value
    of ACL_NOT_CACHED is odd.  In contrast, ACL object pointers always have
    an even value (ACLs are aligned in memory).  This allows to distinguish
    uncached ACLs values from ACL objects.
    
    In addition, switch from guarding inode->i_acl and inode->i_default_acl
    upates by the inode->i_lock spinlock to using xchg() and cmpxchg().
    
    Filesystems that do not want ACLs returned from their get_acl inode
    operations to be cached must call forget_cached_acl() to prevent the VFS
    from doing so.

    ext2: acl: remove unneeded include of linux/capability.h
    
    acl.c has not been (directly) using the interface defined by
    linux/capability.h header since commit 3bd858ab1c451725c07a
    ("Introduce is_owner_or_cap() to wrap CAP_FOWNER use with fsuid
    check"). Remove it.

    Convert ext2, ext3, and ext4 to fully support the posix acl changes,
    using e_uid e_gid instead e_id.
    
    Enabled building with posix acls enabled, all filesystems supporting
    user namespaces, now also support posix acls when user namespaces are enabled.

commit 5f3a4a28ec140a90e6058d1d09f6b1f235d485e5
Author: Eric W. Biederman <ebiederm@xmission.com>
Date:   Mon Sep 10 20:17:44 2012 -0700

    userns: Pass a userns parameter into posix_acl_to_xattr and posix_acl_from_xattr
    
     - Pass the user namespace the uid and gid values in the xattr are stored
       in into posix_acl_from_xattr.
    
     - Pass the user namespace kuid and kgid values should be converted into
       when storing uid and gid values in an xattr in posix_acl_to_xattr.
    
    - Modify all callers of posix_acl_from_xattr and posix_acl_to_xattr to
      pass in &init_user_ns.
    
    In the short term this change is not strictly needed but it makes the
    code clearer.  In the longer term this change is necessary to be able to
    mount filesystems outside of the initial user namespace that natively
    store posix acls in the linux xattr format.

    Replace the ->check_acl method with a ->get_acl method that simply reads an

    new helper: posix_acl_create(&acl, gfp, mode_p).  Replaces acl with

    kill boilerplate around posix_acl_chmod_masq()
    
    new helper: posix_acl_chmod(&acl, gfp, mode).  Replaces acl with modified
    clone or with NULL if that has failed; returns 0 or -ve on error.  All

    exactly the same thing.

commit e77819e57f0817c6dc7cadd061acd70c604cbce2

Date:   Fri Jul 22 19:30:19 2011 -0700

    vfs: move ACL cache lookup into generic code
    
    This moves logic for checking the cached ACL values from low-level
    filesystems into generic code.  The end result is a streamlined ACL
    check that doesn't need to load the inode->i_op->check_acl pointer at
    all for the common cached case.
    
    The filesystems also don't need to check for a non-blocking RCU walk
    case in their acl_check() functions, because that is all handled at a
    VFS layer.

    ext2: update ctime when changing the file's permission by setfacl
    
    ext2 didn't update the ctime of the file when its permission was changed.
    
    Steps to reproduce:
     # touch aaa
     # stat -c %Z aaa
     1275289822
     # setfacl -m  'u::x,g::x,o::x' aaa
     # stat -c %Z aaa
     1275289822                         <- unchanged
    
    But, according to the spec of the ctime, ext2 must update it.

    sanitize xattr handler prototypes
    
    Add a flags argument to struct xattr_handler and pass it to all xattr
    handler methods.  This allows using the same methods for multiple
    handlers, e.g. for the ACL methods which perform exactly the same action
    for the access and default ACLs, just using a different underlying
    attribute.  With a little more groundwork it'll also allow sharing the
    methods for the regular user/trusted/secure handlers in extN, ocfs2 and
    jffs2 like it's already done for xfs in this patch.
    
    Also change the inode argument to the handlers to a dentry to allow
    using the handlers mechnism for filesystems that require it later,
    e.g. cifs.

Date:   Tue Jun 9 12:11:54 2009 -0400

    helpers for acl caching + switch to those
    
    helpers: get_cached_acl(inode, type), set_cached_acl(inode, type, acl),
    forget_cached_acl(inode, type).
    
    ubifs/xattr.c needed includes reordered, the rest is a plain switchover.

    * kill nameidata * argument; map the 3 bits in ->flags anybody cares
      about to new MAY_... ones and pass with the mask.
    * kill redundant gfs2_iop_permission()
    * sanitize ecryptfs_permission()
    * fix remaining places where ->permission() instances might barf on new
      MAY_... found in mask.

commit 3bd858ab1c451725c07a805dcb315215dc85b86e
Author: Satyam Sharma <ssatyam@cse.iitk.ac.in>
Date:   Tue Jul 17 15:00:08 2007 +0530

    Introduce is_owner_or_cap() to wrap CAP_FOWNER use with fsuid check
    
    Introduce is_owner_or_cap() macro in fs.h, and convert over relevant
    users to it. This is done because we want to avoid bugs in the future
    where we check for only effective fsuid of the current task against a
    file's owning uid, without simultaneously checking for CAP_FOWNER as
    well, thus violating its semantics.
    [ XFS uses special macros and structures, and in general looked ...
    untouchable, so we leave it alone -- but it has been looked over. ]
    
    The (current->fsuid != inode->i_uid) check in generic_permission() and
    exec_permission_lite() is left alone, because those operations are
    covered by CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE and CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH. Similarly operations
    falling under the purview of CAP_CHOWN and CAP_LEASE are also left alone.

    [PATCH] Fix acl Oops
    
    )
    
    
    From: Andreas Gruenbacher <agruen@suse.de>
    
    ext[23]_get_acl will return an error when reading the attribute fails or
    out-of-memory occurs.  Catch this case.

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
