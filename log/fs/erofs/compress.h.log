    erofs: move erofs out of staging
    
    EROFS filesystem has been merged into linux-staging for a year.
    
    EROFS is designed to be a better solution of saving extra storage
    space with guaranteed end-to-end performance for read-only files
    with the help of reduced metadata, fixed-sized output compression
    and decompression inplace technologies.
    
    In the past year, EROFS was greatly improved by many people as
    a staging driver, self-tested, betaed by a large number of our
    internal users, successfully applied to almost all in-service
    HUAWEI smartphones as the part of EMUI 9.1 and proven to be stable
    enough to be moved out of staging.
    
    EROFS is a self-contained filesystem driver. Although there are
    still some TODOs to be more generic, we have a dedicated team
    actively keeping on working on EROFS in order to make it better
    with the evolution of Linux kernel as the other in-kernel filesystems.
    
    As Pavel suggested, it's better to do as one commit since git
    can do moves and all histories will be saved in this way.
    
    Let's promote it from staging and enhance it more actively as
    a "real" part of kernel for more wider scenarios!
