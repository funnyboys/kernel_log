    SMB311: Add support for query info using posix extensions (level 100)
    
    Adds support for better query info on dentry revalidation (using
    the SMB3.1.1 POSIX extensions level 100).  Followon patch will
    add support for translating the UID/GID from the SID and also
    will add support for using the posix query info on lookup.

    cifs: remove struct smb2_hdr
    
    struct smb2_hdr is now just a wrapper for smb2_sync_hdr.
    We can thus get rid of smb2_hdr completely and access the sync header directly.

    CIFS: Separate SMB2 header structure
    
    In order to support compounding and encryption we need to separate
    RFC1001 length field and SMB2 header structure because the protocol
    treats them differently. This change will allow to simplify parsing
    of such complex SMB2 packets further.

    remove directory incorrectly tries to set delete on close on non-empty directories
    
    Wrong return code was being returned on SMB3 rmdir of
    non-empty directory.
    
    For SMB3 (unlike for cifs), we attempt to delete a directory by
    set of delete on close flag on the open. Windows clients set
    this flag via a set info (SET_FILE_DISPOSITION to set this flag)
    which properly checks if the directory is empty.
    
    With this patch on smb3 mounts we correctly return
     "DIRECTORY NOT EMPTY"
    on attempts to remove a non-empty directory.

    CIFS: Fix too big maxBuf size for SMB3 mounts
    
    SMB3 servers can respond with MaxTransactSize of more than 4M
    that can cause a memory allocation error returned from kmalloc
    in a lock codepath. Also the client doesn't support multicredit
    requests now and allows buffer sizes of 65536 bytes only. Set
    MaxTransactSize to this maximum supported value.

    [CIFS] SMB3 Signing enablement
    
    SMB3 uses a much faster method of signing (which is also better in other ways),
    AES-CMAC.  With the kernel now supporting AES-CMAC since last release, we
    are overdue to allow SMB3 signing (today only CIFS and SMB2 and SMB2.1,
    but not SMB3 and SMB3.1 can sign) - and we need this also for checking
    secure negotation and also per-share encryption (two other new SMB3 features
    which we need to implement).
    
    This patch needs some work in a few areas - for example we need to
    move signing for SMB2/SMB3 from per-socket to per-user (we may be able to
    use the "nosharesock" mount option in the interim for the multiuser case),
    and Shirish found a bug in the earlier authentication overhaul
    (setting signing flags properly) - but those can be done in followon
    patches.
