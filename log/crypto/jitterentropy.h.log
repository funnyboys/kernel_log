    crypto: jitter - add header to fix buildwarnings
    
    Fix the following build warnings by adding a header for
    the definitions shared between jitterentropy.c and
    jitterentropy-kcapi.c. Fixes the following:
    
    crypto/jitterentropy.c:445:5: warning: symbol 'jent_read_entropy' was not declared. Should it be static?
    crypto/jitterentropy.c:475:18: warning: symbol 'jent_entropy_collector_alloc' was not declared. Should it be static?
    crypto/jitterentropy.c:509:6: warning: symbol 'jent_entropy_collector_free' was not declared. Should it be static?
    crypto/jitterentropy.c:516:5: warning: symbol 'jent_entropy_init' was not declared. Should it be static?
    crypto/jitterentropy-kcapi.c:59:6: warning: symbol 'jent_zalloc' was not declared. Should it be static?
    crypto/jitterentropy-kcapi.c:64:6: warning: symbol 'jent_zfree' was not declared. Should it be static?
    crypto/jitterentropy-kcapi.c:69:5: warning: symbol 'jent_fips_enabled' was not declared. Should it be static?
    crypto/jitterentropy-kcapi.c:74:6: warning: symbol 'jent_panic' was not declared. Should it be static?
    crypto/jitterentropy-kcapi.c:79:6: warning: symbol 'jent_memcpy' was not declared. Should it be static?
    crypto/jitterentropy-kcapi.c:93:6: warning: symbol 'jent_get_nstime' was not declared. Should it be static?
