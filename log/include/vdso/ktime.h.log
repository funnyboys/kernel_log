    linux/ktime.h: Extract common header for vDSO
    
    The vDSO library should only include the necessary headers required for
    a userspace library (UAPI and a minimal set of kernel headers). To make
    this possible it is necessary to isolate from the kernel headers the
    common parts that are strictly necessary to build the library.
    
    Split ktime.h into linux and common headers to make the latter suitable
    for inclusion in the vDSO library.
