    [media] media: Drop FSF's postal address from the source code files
    
    Drop the FSF's postal address from the source code files that typically
    contain mostly the license text. Of the 628 removed instances, 578 are
    outdated.
    
    The patch has been created with the following command without manual edits:
    
    git grep -l "675 Mass Ave\|59 Temple Place\|51 Franklin St" -- \
            drivers/media/ include/media|while read i; do i=$i perl -e '
    open(F,"< $ENV{i}");
    $a=join("", <F>);
    $a =~ s/[ \t]*\*\n.*You should.*\n.*along with.*\n.*(\n.*USA.*$)?\n//m
            && $a =~ s/(^.*)Or, (point your browser to) /$1To obtain the license, $2\n$1/m;
    close(F);
    open(F, "> $ENV{i}");
    print F $a;

commit b5dcee225ce972fecb054e104be22b2a6f65303d
Author: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@osg.samsung.com>
Date:   Tue Nov 10 12:01:44 2015 -0200

    [media] include/media: split I2C headers from V4L2 core
    
    Currently, include/media is messy, as it contains both the V4L2 core
    headers and some driver-specific headers on the same place. That makes
    harder to identify what core headers should be documented and what
    headers belong to I2C drivers that are included only by bridge/main
    drivers that would require the functions provided by them.
    
    Let's move those i2c specific files to its own subdirectory.
    
    The files to move were produced via the following script:
            mkdir include/media/i2c
            (cd include/media; for i in *.h; do n=`echo $i|sed s/.h$/.c/`; if [ -e ../../drivers/media/i2c/$n ]; then echo $i; git mv $i i2c/; fi; done)
            (cd include/media; for i in *.h; do n=`echo $i|sed s/.h$/.c/`; if [ -e ../../drivers/media/*/i2c/$n ]; then echo $i; git mv $i i2c/; fi; done)
            for i in include/media/*.h; do n=`basename $i`;  (for j in $(git grep -l $n); do dirname $j; done)|sort|uniq|grep -ve '^.$' > list; num=$(wc -l list|cut -d' ' -f1); if [ $num == 1 ]; then if [ "`grep i2c list`" != "" ]; then git mv $i include/media/i2c; fi; fi; done
    
    And the references corrected via this script:
        MAIN_DIR="media/"
        PREV_DIR="media/"
        DIRS="i2c/"
    
        echo "Checking affected files" >&2
        for i in $DIRS; do
            for j in $(find include/$MAIN_DIR/$i -type f -name '*.h'); do
                     n=`basename $j`
                    git grep -l $n
            done
        done|sort|uniq >files && (
            echo "Handling files..." >&2;
            echo "for i in \$(cat files|grep -v Documentation); do cat \$i | \\";
            (
                    cd include/$MAIN_DIR;
                    for j in $DIRS; do
                            for i in $(ls $j); do
                                    echo "perl -ne 's,(include [\\\"\\<])$PREV_DIR($i)([\\\"\\>]),\1$MAIN_DIR$j\2\3,; print \$_' |\\";
                            done;
                    done;
                    echo "cat > a && mv a \$i; done";
            );
            echo "Handling documentation..." >&2;
            echo "for i in MAINTAINERS \$(cat files); do cat \$i | \\";
            (
                    cd include/$MAIN_DIR;
                    for j in $DIRS; do
                            for i in $(ls $j); do
                                    echo "  perl -ne 's,include/$PREV_DIR($i)\b,include/$MAIN_DIR$j\1,; print \$_' |\\";
                            done;
                    done;
                    echo "cat > a && mv a \$i; done"
            );
        ) >script && . ./script
