    [media] include/media: split I2C headers from V4L2 core
    
    Currently, include/media is messy, as it contains both the V4L2 core
    headers and some driver-specific headers on the same place. That makes
    harder to identify what core headers should be documented and what
    headers belong to I2C drivers that are included only by bridge/main
    drivers that would require the functions provided by them.
    
    Let's move those i2c specific files to its own subdirectory.
    
    The files to move were produced via the following script:
            mkdir include/media/i2c
            (cd include/media; for i in *.h; do n=`echo $i|sed s/.h$/.c/`; if [ -e ../../drivers/media/i2c/$n ]; then echo $i; git mv $i i2c/; fi; done)
            (cd include/media; for i in *.h; do n=`echo $i|sed s/.h$/.c/`; if [ -e ../../drivers/media/*/i2c/$n ]; then echo $i; git mv $i i2c/; fi; done)
            for i in include/media/*.h; do n=`basename $i`;  (for j in $(git grep -l $n); do dirname $j; done)|sort|uniq|grep -ve '^.$' > list; num=$(wc -l list|cut -d' ' -f1); if [ $num == 1 ]; then if [ "`grep i2c list`" != "" ]; then git mv $i include/media/i2c; fi; fi; done
    
    And the references corrected via this script:
        MAIN_DIR="media/"
        PREV_DIR="media/"
        DIRS="i2c/"
    
        echo "Checking affected files" >&2
        for i in $DIRS; do
            for j in $(find include/$MAIN_DIR/$i -type f -name '*.h'); do
                     n=`basename $j`
                    git grep -l $n
            done
        done|sort|uniq >files && (
            echo "Handling files..." >&2;
            echo "for i in \$(cat files|grep -v Documentation); do cat \$i | \\";
            (
                    cd include/$MAIN_DIR;
                    for j in $DIRS; do
                            for i in $(ls $j); do
                                    echo "perl -ne 's,(include [\\\"\\<])$PREV_DIR($i)([\\\"\\>]),\1$MAIN_DIR$j\2\3,; print \$_' |\\";
                            done;
                    done;
                    echo "cat > a && mv a \$i; done";
            );
            echo "Handling documentation..." >&2;
            echo "for i in MAINTAINERS \$(cat files); do cat \$i | \\";
            (
                    cd include/$MAIN_DIR;
                    for j in $DIRS; do
                            for i in $(ls $j); do
                                    echo "  perl -ne 's,include/$PREV_DIR($i)\b,include/$MAIN_DIR$j\1,; print \$_' |\\";
                            done;
                    done;
                    echo "cat > a && mv a \$i; done"
            );
        ) >script && . ./script
