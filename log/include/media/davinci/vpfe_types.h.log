    [media] media: Drop FSF's postal address from the source code files
    
    Drop the FSF's postal address from the source code files that typically
    contain mostly the license text. Of the 628 removed instances, 578 are
    outdated.
    
    The patch has been created with the following command without manual edits:
    
    git grep -l "675 Mass Ave\|59 Temple Place\|51 Franklin St" -- \
            drivers/media/ include/media|while read i; do i=$i perl -e '
    open(F,"< $ENV{i}");
    $a=join("", <F>);
    $a =~ s/[ \t]*\*\n.*You should.*\n.*along with.*\n.*(\n.*USA.*$)?\n//m
            && $a =~ s/(^.*)Or, (point your browser to) /$1To obtain the license, $2\n$1/m;
    close(F);
    open(F, "> $ENV{i}");
    print F $a;
    close(F);'; done

    V4L/DVB (12248): v4l: vpfe capture bridge driver for DM355 and DM6446
    
    This the vpfe capture bridge driver for doing video
    capture on DM355 and DM6446 evms. The ccdc hw modules register with the
    driver and are used for configuring the CCD Controller for a specific
    decoder interface. The driver also registers the sub devices required
    for a specific evm. More than one sub devices can be registered.
    This allows driver to switch dynamically to capture video from
    any sub device that is registered. Currently only one sub device
    (tvp5146) is supported. But in future this driver is expected
    to do capture from sensor devices such as Micron's MT9T001, MT9T031
    and MT9P031 etc. The driver currently supports MMAP based IO.
