commit f86dec94e3a86c992a637df1c301a4df25a85801
Author: Denys Vlasenko <dvlasenk@redhat.com>
Date:   Fri Apr 15 18:14:25 2016 +0200

    NFC: hci: delete unused nfc_llc_get_rx_head_tail_room()
    
    It used to be EXPORTed, but then EXPORT usage was cleaned up
    (in 2012), without noticing that the function has no users at all
    (and curiously, never had any users).
    
    Delete it.
    
    While at it, remove non-static "inline" hints on nearby functions:
    these hints don't work across compilation units anyway,
    and these functions are not used in their .c file, thus they are
    never inlined. IOW: "inline" here does not help in any way.

    include/net/: Fix FSF address in file headers
    
    Several files refer to an old address for the Free Software Foundation
    in the file header comment.  Resolve by replacing the address with
    the URL <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/> so that we do not have to keep
    updating the header comments anytime the address changes.

    NFC: Add an shdlc llc module to llc core
    
    This is used by HCI drivers such as the one for the pn544 which require
    communications between HCI and the chip to use shdlc.

    NFC: Add a nop (passthrough) llc module to llc core
    
    This is a passthrough llc. It can be used by HCI drivers that don't
    need link layer control. HCI will then write directly to the driver, and
    driver will deliver incoming frames directly to HCI without any
    processing.

    NFC: Add an LLC Core layer to HCI
    
    The LLC layer manages modules that control the link layer protocol (such
    as shdlc) between HCI and an HCI driver. The driver must simply specify
    the required llc when it registers with HCI.
