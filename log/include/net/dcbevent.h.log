    include/net/: Fix FSF address in file headers
    
    Several files refer to an old address for the Free Software Foundation
    in the file header comment.  Resolve by replacing the address with
    the URL <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/> so that we do not have to keep
    updating the header comments anytime the address changes.

    dcbevent.h: Remove extern from function prototypes
    
    There are a mix of function prototypes with and without extern
    in the kernel sources.  Standardize on not using extern for
    function prototypes.
    
    Function prototypes don't need to be written with extern.
    extern is assumed by the compiler.  Its use is as unnecessary as
    using auto to declare automatic/local variables in a block.

    dcb: Add stub routines for !CONFIG_DCB
    
    To avoid ifdefs in the other code that supports DCB notifiers
    add stub routines. This method seems popular in other net code
    for example 8021Q.

    net_dcb: add application notifiers
    
    DCBx applications priorities can be changed dynamically. If
    application stacks are expected to keep the skb priority
    consistent with the dcbx priority the stack will need to
    be notified when these changes occur.
    
    This patch adds application notifiers for the stack to register
    with.
