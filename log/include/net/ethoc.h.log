    inet: whitespace cleanup
    
    Ran simple script to find/remove trailing whitespace and blank lines
    at EOF because that kind of stuff git whines about and editors leave
    behind.

    net: ethoc: set up MII management bus clock
    
    MII management bus clock is derived from the MAC clock by dividing it by
    MIIMODER register CLKDIV field value. This value may need to be set up
    in case it is undefined or its default value is too high (and
    communication with PHY is too slow) or too low (and communication with
    PHY is impossible). The value of CLKDIV is not specified directly, but
    is derived from the MAC clock for the default MII management bus frequency
    of 2.5MHz. The MAC clock may be specified in the platform data, or in
    the 'clocks' device tree attribute.

commit a1702857724fb39cb68ce581490010df99168fd0
Author: Thierry Reding <thierry.reding@avionic-design.de>

    net: Add support for the OpenCores 10/100 Mbps Ethernet MAC.
    
    This patch adds a platform device driver that supports the OpenCores 10/100
    Mbps Ethernet MAC.
    
    The driver expects three resources: one IORESOURCE_MEM resource defines the
    memory region for the core's memory-mapped registers while a second
    IORESOURCE_MEM resource defines the network packet buffer space. The third
    resource, of type IORESOURCE_IRQ, associates an interrupt with the driver.
