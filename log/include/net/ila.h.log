commit 7f00feaf107645d95a6d87e99b4d141ac0a08efd

    ila: Add generic ILA translation facility
    
    This patch implements an ILA tanslation table. This table can be
    configured with identifier to locator mappings, and can be be queried
    to resolve a mapping. Queries can be parameterized based on interface,
    direction (incoming or outoing), and matching locator.  The table is
    implemented using rhashtable and is configured via netlink (through
    "ip ila .." in iproute).
    
    The table may be used as alternative means to do do ILA tanslations
    other than the lw tunnels
