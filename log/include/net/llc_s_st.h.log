    llc: Make llc_sap_action_t function pointer arrays const
    
    It's better when function pointer arrays aren't modifiable.
    
    Net change:
    
    $ size net/llc/built-in.o.*
       text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
      61193   12758    1344   75295   1261f net/llc/built-in.o.new
      47113   27030    1344   75487   126df net/llc/built-in.o.old

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
