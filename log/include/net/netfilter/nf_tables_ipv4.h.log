    netfilter: nf_tables_inet: don't use multihook infrastructure anymore
    
    Use new native NFPROTO_INET support in netfilter core, this gets rid of
    ad-hoc code in the nf_tables API codebase.

    netfilter: nf_tables: explicit nft_set_pktinfo() call from hook path
    
    Instead of calling this function from the family specific variant, this
    reduces the code size in the fast path for the netdev, bridge and inet
    families. After this change, we must call nft_set_pktinfo() upfront from
    the chain hook indirection.

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd
Author: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    netfilter: introduce nft_set_pktinfo_{ipv4, ipv6}_validate()
    
    These functions are extracted from the netdev family, they initialize
    the pktinfo structure and validate that the IPv4 and IPv6 headers are
    well-formed given that these functions are called from a path where
    layer 3 sanitization did not happen yet.
    
    These functions are placed in include/net/netfilter/nf_tables_ipv{4,6}.h
    so they can be reused by a follow up patch to use them from the bridge
    family too.

    netfilter: nf_tables: ensure proper initialization of nft_pktinfo fields
    
    This patch introduces nft_set_pktinfo_unspec() that ensures proper
    initialization all of pktinfo fields for non-IP traffic. This is used
    by the bridge, netdev and arp families.
    
    This new function relies on nft_set_pktinfo_proto_unspec() to set a new
    tprot_set field that indicates if transport protocol information is
    available. Remain fields are zeroed.
    
    The meta expression has been also updated to check to tprot_set in first
    place given that zero is a valid tprot value. Even a handcrafted packet
    may come with the IPPROTO_RAW (255) protocol number so we can't rely on
    this value as tprot unset.

    netfilter: nf_tables: add "inet" table for IPv4/IPv6
    
    This patch adds a new table family and a new filter chain that you can
    use to attach IPv4 and IPv6 rules. This should help to simplify
    rule-set maintainance in dual-stack setups.

    netfilter: nf_tables: add compatibility layer for x_tables
    
    This patch adds the x_tables compatibility layer. This allows you
    to use existing x_tables matches and targets from nf_tables.
    
    This compatibility later allows us to use existing matches/targets
    for features that are still missing in nf_tables. We can progressively
    replace them with native nf_tables extensions. It also provides the
    userspace compatibility software that allows you to express the
    rule-set using the iptables syntax but using the nf_tables kernel
    components.
    
    In order to get this compatibility layer working, I've done the
    following things:
    
    * add NFNL_SUBSYS_NFT_COMPAT: this new nfnetlink subsystem is used
    to query the x_tables match/target revision, so we don't need to
    use the native x_table getsockopt interface.
    
    * emulate xt structures: this required extending the struct nft_pktinfo
    to include the fragment offset, which is already obtained from
    ip[6]_tables and that is used by some matches/targets.
    
    * add support for default policy to base chains, required to emulate
      x_tables.
    
    * add NFTA_CHAIN_USE attribute to obtain the number of references to
      chains, required by x_tables emulation.
    
    * add chain packet/byte counters using per-cpu.
    
    * support 32-64 bits compat.
    
    For historical reasons, this patch includes the following patches
    that were posted in the netfilter-devel mailing list.
    
    From Pablo Neira Ayuso:
    * nf_tables: add default policy to base chains
    * netfilter: nf_tables: add NFTA_CHAIN_USE attribute
    * nf_tables: nft_compat: private data of target and matches in contiguous area
    * nf_tables: validate hooks for compat match/target
    * nf_tables: nft_compat: release cached matches/targets
    * nf_tables: x_tables support as a compile time option
    * nf_tables: fix alias for xtables over nftables module
    * nf_tables: add packet and byte counters per chain
    * nf_tables: fix per-chain counter stats if no counters are passed
    * nf_tables: don't bump chain stats
    * nf_tables: add protocol and flags for xtables over nf_tables
    * nf_tables: add ip[6]t_entry emulation
    * nf_tables: move specific layer 3 compat code to nf_tables_ipv[4|6]
    * nf_tables: support 32bits-64bits x_tables compat
    * nf_tables: fix compilation if CONFIG_COMPAT is disabled
    
    From Patrick McHardy:
    * nf_tables: move policy to struct nft_base_chain
    * nf_tables: send notifications for base chain policy changes
    
    From Alexander Primak:
    * nf_tables: remove the duplicate NF_INET_LOCAL_OUT
    
    From Nicolas Dichtel:
    * nf_tables: fix compilation when nf-netlink is a module
