    netfilter: check if the socket netns is correct.
    
    Netfilter assumes that if the socket is present in the skb, then
    it can be used because that reference is cleaned up while the skb
    is crossing netns.
    
    We want to change that to preserve the socket reference in a future
    patch, so this is a preparation updating netfilter to check if the
    socket netns matches before use it.

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    netfilter: allow logging from non-init namespaces
    
    Commit 69b34fb996b2 ("netfilter: xt_LOG: add net namespace support for
    xt_LOG") disabled logging packets using the LOG target from non-init
    namespaces. The motivation was to prevent containers from flooding
    kernel log of the host. The plan was to keep it that way until syslog
    namespace implementation allows containers to log in a safe way.
    
    However, the work on syslog namespace seems to have hit a dead end
    somewhere in 2013 and there are users who want to use xt_LOG in all
    network namespaces. This patch allows to do so by setting
    
      /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_log_all_netns
    
    to a nonzero value. This sysctl is only accessible from init_net so that
    one cannot switch the behaviour from inside a container.

    netfilter: nf_log: do not assume ethernet header in netdev family
    
    In netdev family, we will handle non ethernet packets, so using
    eth_hdr(skb)->h_proto is incorrect.
    
    Meanwhile, we can use socket(AF_PACKET...) to sending packets, so
    skb->protocol is not always set in bridge family.
    
    Add an extra parameter into nf_log_l2packet to solve this issue.

    netfilter: nft_log: complete NFTA_LOG_FLAGS attr support
    
    NFTA_LOG_FLAGS attribute is already supported, but the related
    NF_LOG_XXX flags are not exposed to the userspace. So we cannot
    explicitly enable log flags to log uid, tcp sequence, ip options
    and so on, i.e. such rule "nft add rule filter output log uid"
    is not supported yet.
    
    So move NF_LOG_XXX macro definitions to the uapi/../nf_log.h. In
    order to keep consistent with other modules, change NF_LOG_MASK to
    refer to all supported log flags. On the other hand, add a new
    NF_LOG_DEFAULT_MASK to refer to the original default log flags.
    
    Finally, if user specify the unsupported log flags or NFTA_LOG_GROUP
    and NFTA_LOG_FLAGS are set at the same time, report EINVAL to the
    userspace.

    li->u.ulog.copy_len is currently ignored by the kernel, we should truncate
    the packet to either li->u.ulog.copy_len (if set) or copy_range before
    sending it to userspace. 0 is a valid input for copy_len, so add a new
    flag to indicate whether this was option was specified by the user or not.
    
    Add two flags to indicate whether nflog-size/copy_len was set or not.
    XT_NFLOG_F_COPY_LEN is for XT_NFLOG and NFLOG_F_COPY_LEN for nfnetlink_log
    
    On the userspace side, this was initially represented by the option
    nflog-range, this will be replaced by --nflog-size now. --nflog-range would
    still exist but does not do anything.

    netfilter: restore rule tracing via nfnetlink_log
    
    Since fab4085 ("netfilter: log: nf_log_packet() as real unified
    interface"), the loginfo structure that is passed to nf_log_packet() is
    used to explicitly indicate the logger type you want to use.
    
    This is a problem for people tracing rules through nfnetlink_log since
    packets are always routed to the NF_LOG_TYPE logger after the
    aforementioned patch.
    
    We can fix this by removing the trace loginfo structures, but that still
    changes the log level from 4 to 5 for tracing messages and there may be
    someone relying on this outthere. So let's just introduce a new
    nf_log_trace() function that restores the former behaviour.

    netfilter: bridge: add generic packet logger
    
    This adds the generic plain text packet loggger for bridged packets.
    It routes the logging message to the real protocol packet logger.
    I decided not to refactor the ebt_log code for two reasons:
    
    1) The ebt_log output is not consistent with the IPv4 and IPv6
       Netfilter packet loggers. The output is different for no good
       reason and it adds redundant code to handle packet logging.
    
    2) To avoid breaking backward compatibility for applications
       outthere that are parsing the specific ebt_log output, the ebt_log
       output has been left as is. So only nftables will use the new
       consistent logging format for logged bridged packets.
    
    More decisions coming in this patch:
    
    1) This also removes ebt_log as default logger for bridged packets.
       Thus, nf_log_packet() routes packet to this new packet logger
       instead. This doesn't break backward compatibility since
       nf_log_packet() is not used to log packets in plain text format
       from anywhere in the ebtables/netfilter bridge code.
    
    2) The new bridge packet logger also performs a lazy request to
       register the real IPv4, ARP and IPv6 netfilter packet loggers.
       If the real protocol logger is no available (not compiled or the
       module is not available in the system, not packet logging happens.

    netfilter: log: nf_log_packet() as real unified interface
    
    Before this patch, the nf_loginfo parameter specified the logging
    configuration in case the specified default logger was loaded. This
    patch updates the semantics of the nf_loginfo parameter in
    nf_log_packet() which now indicates the logger that you explicitly
    want to use.
    
    Thus, nf_log_packet() is exposed as an unified interface which
    internally routes the log message to the corresponding logger type
    by family.
    
    The module dependencies are expressed by the new nf_logger_find_get()
    and nf_logger_put() functions which bump the logger module refcount.
    Thus, you can not remove logger modules that are used by rules anymore.
    
    Another important effect of this change is that the family specific
    module is only loaded when required. Therefore, xt_LOG and nft_log
    will just trigger the autoload of the nf_log_{ip,ip6} modules
    according to the family.

    netfilter: log: split family specific code to nf_log_{ip,ip6,common}.c files
    
    The plain text logging is currently embedded into the xt_LOG target.
    In order to be able to use the plain text logging from nft_log, as a
    first step, this patch moves the family specific code to the following
    files and Kconfig symbols:
    
    1) net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_log_ip.c: CONFIG_NF_LOG_IPV4
    2) net/ipv6/netfilter/nf_log_ip6.c: CONFIG_NF_LOG_IPV6
    3) net/netfilter/nf_log_common.c: CONFIG_NF_LOG_COMMON
    
    These new modules will be required by xt_LOG and nft_log. This patch
    is based on original patch from Arturo Borrero Gonzalez.

    netfilter: nf_log: move log buffering to core logging
    
    This patch moves Eric Dumazet's log buffer implementation from the
    xt_log.h header file to the core net/netfilter/nf_log.c. This also
    includes the renaming of the structure and functions to avoid possible
    undesired namespace clashes.
    
    This change allows us to use it from the arp and bridge packet logging
    implementation in follow up patches.

    netfilter: nf_log: use an array of loggers instead of list
    
    Now that legacy ulog targets are not available anymore in the tree, we
    can have up to two possible loggers:
    
    1) The plain text logging via kernel logging ring.
    2) The nfnetlink_log infrastructure which delivers log messages
       to userspace.
    
    This patch replaces the list of loggers by an array of two pointers
    per family for each possible logger and it also introduces a new field
    to the nf_logger structure which indicates the position in the logger
    array (based on the logger type).
    
    This prepares a follow up patch that consolidates the nf_log_packet()
    interface by allowing to specify the logger as parameter.

    when callling log functions from conntrack both in and out
    are NULL i.e. the net pointer is invalid.

    netfilter: nf_log: prepare net namespace support for loggers
    
    This patch adds netns support to nf_log and it prepares netns
    support for existing loggers. It is composed of four major
    changes.
    
    1) nf_log_register has been split to two functions: nf_log_register
       and nf_log_set. The new nf_log_register is used to globally
       register the nf_logger and nf_log_set is used for enabling
       pernet support from nf_loggers.
    
       Per netns is not yet complete after this patch, it comes in
       separate follow up patches.
    
    2) Add net as a parameter of nf_log_bind_pf. Per netns is not
       yet complete after this patch, it only allows to bind the
       nf_logger to the protocol family from init_net and it skips
       other cases.
    
    3) Adapt all nf_log_packet callers to pass netns as parameter.
       After this patch, this function only works for init_net.
    
    4) Make the sysctl net/netfilter/nf_log pernet.

    netfilter: use a linked list of loggers
    
    This patch modifies nf_log to use a linked list of loggers for each
    protocol. This list of loggers is read and write protected with a
    mutex.
    
    This patch separates registration and binding. To be used as
    logging module, a module has to register calling nf_log_register()
    and to bind to a protocol it has to call nf_log_bind_pf().
    This patch also converts the logging modules to the new API. For nfnetlink_log,
    it simply switchs call to register functions to call to bind function and
    adds a call to nf_log_register() during init. For other modules, it just
    remove a const flag from the logger structure and replace it with a
    __read_mostly.
