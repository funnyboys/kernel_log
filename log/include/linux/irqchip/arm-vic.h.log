commit e641b987c20832dfaaa51d7792ed928c2b2d2dbf
Author: Linus Walleij <linus.walleij@linaro.org>
Date:   Thu Nov 21 23:11:29 2013 +0100

    irqchip: support cascaded VICs
    
    This adds support for a VIC to be cascaded off another IRQ.
    On the Integrator/AP logical module IM-PD1 there is a VIC
    cascaded off the central FPGA IRQ controller so this is
    needed for that to work out.
    
    In order for the plug-in board to be able to register all
    the devices with their IRQs relative to the offset of the
    base obtained for the cascaded VIC, the base IRQ number
    is passed back to the caller.

    irqchip: Move ARM vic.h to include/linux/irqchip/arm-vic.h
    
    Now that we have VIC moved to drivers/irqchip and all VIC DT init for
    platforms using irqchip_init, move gic.h and update the remaining
    includes.
