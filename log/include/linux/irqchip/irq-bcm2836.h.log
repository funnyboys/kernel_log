commit 88bbe85dcd37aa2662c1a83962c15009fc12503e

    irqchip: bcm2836: Move SMP startup code to arch/arm (v2)
    
    In order to easily provide SMP for BCM2837 on 32-bit and 64-bit
    the SMP startup code was placed in irq-bcm2836. That's not the
    right approach. So move this code where it belongs.
