    y2038: globally rename compat_time to old_time32
    
    Christoph Hellwig suggested a slightly different path for handling
    backwards compatibility with the 32-bit time_t based system calls:
    
    Rather than simply reusing the compat_sys_* entry points on 32-bit
    architectures unchanged, we get rid of those entry points and the
    compat_time types by renaming them to something that makes more sense
    on 32-bit architectures (which don't have a compat mode otherwise),
    and then share the entry points under the new name with the 64-bit
    architectures that use them for implementing the compatibility.
    
    The following types and interfaces are renamed here, and moved
    from linux/compat_time.h to linux/time32.h:
    
    old                             new
    ---                             ---
    compat_time_t                   old_time32_t
    struct compat_timeval           struct old_timeval32
    struct compat_timespec          struct old_timespec32
    struct compat_itimerspec        struct old_itimerspec32
    ns_to_compat_timeval()          ns_to_old_timeval32()
    get_compat_itimerspec64()       get_old_itimerspec32()
    put_compat_itimerspec64()       put_old_itimerspec32()
    compat_get_timespec64()         get_old_timespec32()
    compat_put_timespec64()         put_old_timespec32()
    
    As we already have aliases in place, this patch addresses only the
    instances that are relevant to the system call interface in particular,
    not those that occur in device drivers and other modules. Those
    will get handled separately, while providing the 64-bit version
    of the respective interfaces.
    
    I'm not renaming the timex, rusage and itimerval structures, as we are
    still debating what the new interface will look like, and whether we
    will need a replacement at all.
    
    This also doesn't change the names of the syscall entry points, which can
    be done more easily when we actually switch over the 32-bit architectures
    to use them, at that point we need to change COMPAT_SYSCALL_DEFINEx to
    SYSCALL_DEFINEx with a new name, e.g. with a _time32 suffix.

    time: Change nanosleep to safe __kernel_* types
    
    Change over clock_nanosleep syscalls to use y2038 safe
    __kernel_timespec times. This will enable changing over
    of these syscalls to use new y2038 safe syscalls when
    the architectures define the CONFIG_64BIT_TIME.
    
    Note that nanosleep syscall is deprecated and does not have a
    plan for making it y2038 safe. But, the syscall should work as
    before on 64 bit machines and on 32 bit machines, the syscall
    works correctly until y2038 as before using the existing compat
    syscall version. There is no new syscall for supporting 64 bit
    time_t on 32 bit architectures.

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    time/posix-timers: Move the compat copyouts to the nanosleep implementations
    
    Turn restart_block.nanosleep.{rmtp,compat_rmtp} into a tagged union (kind =
    1 -> native, kind = 2 -> compat, kind = 0 -> nothing) and make the places
    doing actual copyout handle compat as well as native (that will become a
    helper in the next commit).  Result: compat wrappers, messing with
    reassignments, etc. are gone.

commit 53d74d056a4e306a72b8883d325b5d853c0618e6
Author: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>

    thread_info: factor out restart_block
    
    Since commit f56141e3e2d9aabf ("all arches, signal: move restart_block
    to struct task_struct"), thread_info and restart_block have been
    logically distinct, yet struct restart_block is still defined in
    <linux/thread_info.h>.
    
    At least one architecture (erroneously) uses restart_block as part of
    its thread_info, and thus the definition of restart_block must come
    before the include of <asm/thread_info>. Subsequent patches in this
    series need to shuffle the order of includes and definitions in
    <linux/thread_info.h>, and will make this ordering fragile.
    
    This patch moves the definition of restart_block out to its own header.
    This serves as generic cleanup, logically separating thread_info and
    restart_block, and also makes it easier to avoid fragility.
