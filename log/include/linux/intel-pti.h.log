    drivers/misc/intel/pti: Rename the header file to free up the namespace
    
    We'd like to use the 'PTI' acronym for 'Page Table Isolation' - free up the
    namespace by renaming the <linux/pti.h> driver header to <linux/intel-pti.h>.
    
    (Also standardize the header guard name while at it.)
