    mtd: rawnand: Stop using nand_release()
    
    This helper is not very useful and very often people get confused:
    they use nand_release() instead of nand_cleanup().
    
    Now that all drivers have been converted to do not use nand_release()
    anymore, let's remove this helper.

    mtd: nand: remove NAND_BBT_SCANEMPTY
    
    NAND_BBT_SCANEMPTY is a strange, badly-supported option with omap as its
    single remaining user.
    
    NAND_BBT_SCANEMPTY was likely used by accident in omap2[1]. And anyway,
    omap2 doesn't scan the chip for bad blocks (courtesy of
    NAND_SKIP_BBTSCAN), and so its use of this option is irrelevant.
    
    This patch drops the NAND_BBT_SCANEMPTY option.

    mtd: nand: write BBM to OOB even with flash-based BBT
    
    Currently, the flash-based BBT implementation writes bad block data only
    to its flash-based table and not to the OOB marker area. Then, as new bad
    blocks are marked over time, the OOB markers become incomplete and the
    flash-based table becomes the only source of current bad block
    information. This becomes an obvious problem when, for example:
    
     * bootloader cannot read the flash-based BBT format
     * BBT is corrupted and the flash must be rescanned for bad
       blocks; we want to remember bad blocks that were marked from Linux
    
    So to keep the bad block markers in sync with the flash-based BBT, this
    patch changes the default so that we write bad block markers to the proper
    OOB area on each block in addition to flash-based BBT. Comments are
    updated, expanded, and/or relocated as necessary.
    
    The new flash-based BBT procedure for marking bad blocks:
     (1) erase the affected block, to allow OOB marker to be written cleanly
     (2) update in-memory BBT
     (3) write bad block marker to OOB area of affected block
     (4) update flash-based BBT
    Note that we retain the first error encountered in (3) or (4), finish the
    procedures, and dump the error in the end.
    
    This should handle power cuts gracefully enough. (1) and (2) are mostly
    harmless (note that (1) will not erase an already-recognized bad block).
    The OOB and BBT may be "out of sync" if we experience power loss bewteen
    (3) and (4), but we can reasonably expect that on next boot, subsequent
    I/O operations will discover that the block should be marked bad again,
    thus re-syncing the OOB and BBT.
    
    Note that this is a change from the previous default flash-based BBT
    behavior. If your system cannot support writing bad block markers to OOB,
    use the new NAND_BBT_NO_OOB_BBM option (in combination with
    NAND_BBT_USE_FLASH and NAND_BBT_NO_OOB).

    mtd: nand: rename CREATE_EMPTY bbt flag with proper prefix
    
    According to our new prefix rules, we should rename NAND_CREATE_EMPTY_BBT
    with a NAND_BBT prefix, i.e., NAND_BBT_CREATE_EMPTY.

    mtd: nand: move NAND_CREATE_EMPTY_BBT flag
    
    The NAND_CREATE_EMPTY_BBT flag was added by commit:
      453281a973c10bce941b240d1c654d536623b16b
      mtd: nand: introduce NAND_CREATE_EMPTY_BBT
    This flag is not used within the kernel and not explained well, so I
    took the liberty to edit its comments.
    
    Also, this is a BBT-related flag (and closely tied with NAND_BBT_CREATE)
    so I'm moving it to bbm.h next to NAND_BBT_CREATE, thus requiring that
    we use the flag in nand_chip.bbt_options, *not* in nand_chip.options.

    mtd: nand: rename NAND_USE_FLASH_BBT
    
    Recall the recently added prefix requirements:
     * "NAND_" for flags in nand.h, used in nand_chip.options
     * "NAND_BBT_" for flags in bbm.h, used in nand_chip.bbt_options
            or in nand_bbt_descr.options
    
    Thus, I am changing NAND_USE_FLASH_BBT to NAND_BBT_USE_FLASH.
    
    Again, this flag is found in bbm.h and so should NOT be used in the
    "nand_chip.options" field.

    mtd: nand: consolidate redundant flash-based BBT flags
    
    This patch works with the following three flags from two headers (nand.h
    and bbm.h):
      (1) NAND_USE_FLASH_BBT (nand.h)
      (2) NAND_USE_FLASH_BBT_NO_OOB (nand.h)
      (3) NAND_BBT_NO_OOB (bbm.h)
    
    These flags are all related and interdependent, yet they were in
    different headers. Flag (2) is simply the combination of (1) and (3) and
    can be eliminated.
    
    This patch accomplishes the following:
      * eliminate NAND_USE_FLASH_BBT_NO_OOB (i.e., flag (2))
      * move NAND_USE_FLASH_BBT (i.e., flag (1)) to bbm.h
    
    It's important to note that because (1) and (3) are now both found in
    bbm.h, they should NOT be used in the "nand_chip.options" field.
    
    I removed a small section from the mtdnand DocBook because it referes to
    NAND_USE_FLASH_BBT in nand.h, which has been moved to bbm.h.

    mtd: nand: remove NAND_BBT_SCANBYTE1AND6 option
    
    This patch reverts most of:
        commit 58373ff0afff4cc8ac40608872995f4d87eb72ec
        mtd: nand: more BB Detection refactoring and dynamic scan options
    
    According to the discussion at:
        http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-mtd/2011-May/035696.html
    the NAND_BBT_SCANBYTE1AND6 flag, although technically valid, can break
    some existing ECC layouts that use the 6th byte in the OOB for ECC data.
    Furthermore, we apparently do not need to scan both bytes 1 and 6 in
    the OOB region of the devices under consideration; instead, we only need
    to scan one or the other.
    
    Thus, the NAND_BBT_SCANBYTE1AND6 flag is at best unnecessary and at
    worst a regression.

    mtd: nand: add support for BBT without OOB
    
    The first (sixt) byte in the OOB area contains vendor's bad block
    information. During identification of the NAND chip this information is
    collected by scanning the complete chip.
    The option NAND_USE_FLASH_BBT is used to store this information in a sector so
    we don't have to scan the complete flash. Unfortunately the code stores
    a marker in order to recognize the BBT in the OOB area. This will fail
    if the OOB area is completely used for ECC.
    This patch introduces the option NAND_USE_FLASH_BBT_NO_OOB which has to be
    used with NAND_USE_FLASH_BBT. It will then store BBT on flash without
    touching the OOB area. The BBT format on flash remains same except the
    first page starts with the recognition pattern followed by the version byte.
    This change was tested in nandsim and it looks good so far :)

    mtd: nand: more BB Detection refactoring and dynamic scan options
    
    This is a revision to PATCH 2/2 that I sent. Link:
    http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-mtd/2010-July/030911.html
    
    Added new flag for scanning of both bytes 1 and 6 of the OOB for
    a BB marker (instead of simply one or the other).
    
    The "check_pattern" and "check_short_pattern" functions were updated
    to include support for scanning the two different locations in the OOB.
    
    In order to handle increases in variety of necessary scanning patterns,
    I implemented dynamic memory allocation of nand_bbt_descr structs
    in new function 'nand_create_default_bbt_descr()'. This replaces
    some increasingly-unwieldy, statically-declared descriptors. It can
    replace several more (e.g. "flashbased" structs). However, I do not
    test the flashbased options personally.
    
    How this was tested:
    
    I referenced 30+ data sheets (covering 100+ parts), and I tested a
    selection of 10 different chips to varying degrees. Particularly, I
    tested the creation of bad-block descriptors and basic BB scanning on
    three parts:
    
    ST NAND04GW3B2D, 2K page
    ST NAND128W3A, 512B page
    Samsung K9F1G08U0A, 2K page
    
    To test these, I wrote some fake bad block markers to the flash (in OOB
    bytes 1, 6, and elsewhere) to see if the scanning routine would detect
    them properly. However, this method was somewhat limited because the
    driver I am using has some bugs in its OOB write functionality.

    mtd: nand: edit macro flag for BBT scan of last page in block
    
    NAND_BB_LAST_PAGE used to be in nand.h, but it pertained to bad block
    management and so belongs next to NAND_BBT_SCAN2NDPAGE in bbm.h. Also,
    its previous flag value (0x00000400) conflicted with NAND_BBT_SCANALLPAGES
    so I changed its value to 0x00008000. All uses of the name were modified to
    provide consistency with other "NAND_BBT_*" flags.

commit ea9b6dcc152f09c207117ab121d4fa03d2db282a
Author: Randy Dunlap <rdunlap@xenotime.net>
Date:   Wed Jun 28 21:48:38 2006 -0700

    MTD: kernel-doc fixes + additions
    
    Fix some kernel-doc typos/spellos.
    Use kernel-doc syntax in places where it was almost used.
    Correct/add struct, struct field, and function param names where needed.
