commit f6a8c60960bbea378142d1fa1b3d111555ee41c7
Author: Russell King - ARM Linux <linux@arm.linux.org.uk>
Date:   Sun Nov 29 15:23:51 2009 +0000

    mtd: Really add ARM pismo support
    
    (Commit 7cb777a3d71f9d1f7eb149c7a504d21f24219ae8 (mtd: add ARM pismo support)
    intended to add this, but seems only to have patched the Makefile without
    touching Kconfig or providing any code...)
    
    The following patch adds support for PISMO modules found on ARM Ltd
    development platforms.  These are MTD modules, and can have a
    selection of SRAM, flash or DOC devices as described by an on-board
    I2C EEPROM.
    
    We support SRAM and NOR flash devices only by registering appropriate
    conventional MTD platform devices as children of the 'pismo' device.
