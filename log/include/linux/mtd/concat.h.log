commit 59018b6d2acabb114ab58637e6ab95ba424a89d0

Date:   Tue May 20 01:03:52 2008 +0300

    MTD/JFFS2: remove CVS keywords
    
    Once upon a time, the MTD repository was using CVS.
    
    This patch therefore removes all usages of the no longer updated CVS
    keywords from the MTD code.
    
    This also includes code that printed them to the user.

commit 1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
