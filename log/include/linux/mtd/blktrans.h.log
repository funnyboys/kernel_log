    mtd_blkdevs: convert to blk-mq
    
    Straight forward conversion, using an internal list to enable the
    driver to pull requests at will.
    
    Dynamically allocate the tag set to avoid having to pull in the
    block headers for blktrans.h, since various mtd drivers use
    block conflicting names for defines and functions.

    mtd: mtd_blkdevs: Replace request handler kthread with a workqueue
    
    By replacing a kthread with a workqueue, the code is now a bit clearer.
    There's also a slight reduction of code size (numbers apply for x86):
    Before:
       text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
       3248      36       0    3284     cd4 drivers/mtd/mtd_blkdevs.o
    
    After:
       text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
       3150      36       0    3186     c72 drivers/mtd/mtd_blkdevs.o
    
    Due to lack of real hardware, tests have been performed on an emulated
    environment with mtdswap and mtdblock over nandsim devices.
    Some real testing should be done, before merging this patch.

    NOTE!
    
    This merge commit was created to fix compilation error. The block
    tree was merged upstream and removed the 'elv_queue_empty()'
    function which the new 'mtdswap' driver is using. So a simple
    merge of the mtd tree with upstream does not compile. And the
    mtd tree has already be published, so re-basing it is not an option.
    
    To fix this unfortunate situation, I had to merge upstream into the
    mtd-2.6.git tree without committing, put the fixup patch on top of
    this, and then commit this. The result is that we do not have commits
    which do not compile.
    
    In other words, this merge commit "merges" 3 things: the MTD tree, the
    upstream tree, and the fixup patch.

    mtd_blkdevs: Add background processing support
    
    Add a new background method into mtd_blktrans_ops, add background support
    into mtd_blktrans_thread(), and add mtd_blktrans_cease_background().
    
    If the mtd blktrans dev has the background support, the thread will
    call background function when the request queue becomes empty. The background
    operation may run as long as needs to until
    mtd_blktrans_cease_background() tells to stop.

    * Add locking where it was missing.
    
    * Don't do a get_mtd_device in blktrans_open because it would lead to a

    * Only free the mtd_blktrans_dev structure when the last user exits.
    
    * Flush request queue on device removal.
    
    * Track users, and call tr->release in del_mtd_blktrans_dev
      Due to that ->open and release aren't called more that once.
    
    Now it is safe to call del_mtd_blktrans_dev while the device is still in use.

    [MTD] Allow variable block sizes in mtd_blkdevs
    
    Currently, mtd_blkdevs enforces a block size of 512, even if the drivers
    can seemingly request a different size. This patch fixes mtd_blkdevs so
    block sizes other than 512 work correctly.

commit 48b192686dd20cb1576ae1d8ccd17a07971ef24a
Author: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 02:29:41 2006 -0800

    [PATCH] sem2mutex: drivers/mtd/
    
    Semaphore to mutex conversion.
    
    The conversion was generated via scripts, and the result was validated
    automatically via a script as well.

commit 1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org>

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
