    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    lis3lv02d: make regulator API usage unconditional
    
    The regulator API contains a range of features for stubbing itself out
    when not in use and for transparently restricting the actual effect of
    regulator API calls where they can't be supported on a particular system
    so that drivers don't need to individually implement this.  Simplify the
    driver slightly by making use of this idiom.
    
    The only in tree user is ecovec24 which does not use the regulator API.

    hwmon: lis3: use block read to access data registers
    
    Add optional blockread function to interface driver. If available
    the chip driver uses it for data register access. For 12 bit device
    it reads 6 bytes to get 3*16bit data. For 8 bit device it reads out
    5 bytes since every second byte is dummy.
    This optimizes bus usage and reduces number of operations and
    interrupts needed for one data update.

    lis3: interrupt handlers for 8bit wakeup and click events
    
    Content for the 8bit device threaded interrupt handlers.  Depending on the
    interrupt line and chip configuration, either click or wakeup / freefall
    handler is called.  In case of click, BTN_ event is sent via input device.
     In case of wakeup or freefall, input device ABS_ events are updated
    immediatelly.
    
    It is still possible to configure interrupt line 1 for fast freefall
    detection and use the second line either for click or threshold based
    interrupts.  Or both lines can be used for click / threshold interrupts.
    
    Polled input device can be set to stopped state and still get coordinate
    updates via input device using interrupt based method.  Polled mode and
    interrupt mode can also be used parallel.
    
    BTN_ events are remapped based on existing axis remapping information.

    lis3: introduce platform data for second ff / wu unit
    
    8 bit device has two wakeup / free fall units.  It was not possible to
    configure the second unit.  This patch introduces configuration entry to
    the platform data and also corresponding changes to the 8 bit setup
    function.
    
    High pass filters were enabled by default.  Patch introduces configuration
    option for high pass filter cut off frequency and also possibility to
    disable or enable the filter via platform data.  Since the control is a
    new one and default state was filter enabled, new option is used to
    disable the filter.  This way old platform data is still compatible with
    the change.

    lis3: selftest support
    
    Implement selftest feature as specified by chip manufacturer.  Control:
    read selftest sysfs entry
    
    Response: "OK x y z" or "FAIL x y z"
    
    where x, y, and z are difference between selftest mode and normal mode.
    Test is passed when values are within acceptance limit values.
    
    Acceptance limits are provided via platform data.  See chip spesifications
    for acceptance limits.  If limits are not properly set, OK / FAIL decision
    is meaningless.  However, userspace application can still make decision
    based on the numeric x, y, z values.
    
    Selftest is meant for HW diagnostic purposes.  It is not meant to be
    called during normal use of the chip.  It may cause false interrupt
    events.  Selftest mode delays polling of the normal results but it doesn't
    cause wrong values.  Chip must be in static state during selftest.  Any
    acceration during the test causes most probably failure.

    lis3: add click function
    
    The LIS302DL accelerometer chip has a 'click' feature which can be used to
    detect sudden motion on any of the three axis.  Configuration data is
    passed via spi platform_data and no action is taken if that's not
    specified, so it won't harm any existing platform.
    
    To make the configuration effective, the IRQ lines need to be set up
    appropriately.  This patch also adds a way to do that from board support
    code.
    
    The DD_* definitions were factored out to an own enum because they are
    specific to LIS3LV02D devices.
