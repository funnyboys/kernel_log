    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    task IO accounting: move all IO statistics in struct task_io_accounting
    
    Simplify the code of include/linux/task_io_accounting.h.
    
    It is also more reasonable to have all the task i/o-related statistics in a
    single struct (task_io_accounting).

    task IO accounting: improve code readability
    
    Put all i/o statistics in struct proc_io_accounting and use inline functions to
    initialize and increment statistics, removing a lot of single variable
    assignments.
    
    This also reduces the kernel size as following (with CONFIG_TASK_XACCT=y and
    CONFIG_TASK_IO_ACCOUNTING=y).

    Detach sched.h from mm.h
    
    First thing mm.h does is including sched.h solely for can_do_mlock() inline
    function which has "current" dereference inside. By dealing with can_do_mlock()
    mm.h can be detached from sched.h which is good. See below, why.
    
    This patch
    a) removes unconditional inclusion of sched.h from mm.h
    b) makes can_do_mlock() normal function in mm/mlock.c
    c) exports can_do_mlock() to not break compilation
    d) adds sched.h inclusions back to files that were getting it indirectly.
    e) adds less bloated headers to some files (asm/signal.h, jiffies.h) that were
       getting them indirectly
    
    Net result is:
    a) mm.h users would get less code to open, read, preprocess, parse, ... if
       they don't need sched.h
    b) sched.h stops being dependency for significant number of files:
       on x86_64 allmodconfig touching sched.h results in recompile of 4083 files,
       after patch it's only 3744 (-8.3%).
    
    Cross-compile tested on
    
            all arm defconfigs, all mips defconfigs, all powerpc defconfigs,

    getrusage(): fill ru_inblock and ru_oublock fields if possible
    
    If CONFIG_TASK_IO_ACCOUNTING is defined, we update io accounting counters for
    each task.
    
    This patch permits reporting of values using the well known getrusage()
    syscall, filling ru_inblock and ru_oublock instead of null values.
    
    As TASK_IO_ACCOUNTING currently counts bytes counts, we approximate blocks
    count doing : nr_blocks = nr_bytes / 512
    
    Example of use :
    ----------------------
    After patch is applied, /usr/bin/time command can now give a good
    approximation of IO that the process had to do.

    [PATCH] io-accounting: core statistics
    
    The present per-task IO accounting isn't very useful.  It simply counts the
    number of bytes passed into read() and write().  So if a process reads 1MB
    from an already-cached file, it is accused of having performed 1MB of I/O,
    which is wrong.
    
    (David Wright had some comments on the applicability of the present logical IO accounting:
    
      For billing purposes it is useless but for workload analysis it is very
      useful
    
      read_bytes/read_calls  average read request size
      write_bytes/write_calls average write request size
    
      read_bytes/read_blocks ie logical/physical can indicate hit rate or thrashing
      write_bytes/write_blocks  ie logical/physical  guess since pdflush writes can
                                                    be missed
    
      I often look for logical larger than physical to see filesystem cache
      problems.  And the bytes/cpusec can help find applications that are
      dominating the cache and causing slow interactive response from page cache
      contention.
    
      I want to find the IO intensive applications and make sure they are doing
      efficient IO.  Thus the acctcms(sysV) or csacms command would give the high
      IO commands).
    
    This patchset adds new accounting which tries to be more accurate.  We account
    for three things:
    
    reads:
    
      attempt to count the number of bytes which this process really did cause
      to be fetched from the storage layer.  Done at the submit_bio() level, so it
      is accurate for block-backed filesystems.  I also attempt to wire up NFS and
      CIFS.
    
    writes:
    
      attempt to count the number of bytes which this process caused to be sent
      to the storage layer.  This is done at page-dirtying time.
    
      The big inaccuracy here is truncate.  If a process writes 1MB to a file
      and then deletes the file, it will in fact perform no writeout.  But it will
      have been accounted as having caused 1MB of write.
    
      So...
    
    cancelled_writes:
    
      account the number of bytes which this process caused to not happen, by
      truncating pagecache.
    
      We _could_ just subtract this from the process's `write' accounting.  But
      that means that some processes would be reported to have done negative
      amounts of write IO, which is silly.
    
      So we just report the raw number and punt this decision up to userspace.
    
    Now, we _could_ account for writes at the physical I/O level.  But
    
    - This would require that we track memory-dirtying tasks at the per-page
      level (would require a new pointer in struct page).
    
    - It would mean that IO statistics for a process are usually only available
      long after that process has exitted.  Which means that we probably cannot
      communicate this info via taskstats.
    
    This patch:
    
    Wire up the kernel-private data structures and the accessor functions to
    manipulate them.
