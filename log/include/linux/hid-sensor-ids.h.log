    iio: hid-sensor-hub: Implement batch mode
    
    HID sensor hubs using Integrated Senor Hub (ISH) has added capability to
    support batch mode. This allows host processor to go to sleep for extended
    duration, while the sensor hub is storing samples in its internal buffers.
    
    'Commit f4f4673b7535 ("iio: add support for hardware fifo")' implements
    feature in IIO core to implement such feature. This feature is used in
    bmc150-accel-core.c to implement batch mode. This implementation allows
    software device buffer watermark to be used as a hint to adjust hardware
    FIFO.
    
    But HID sensor hubs don't allow to change internal buffer size of FIFOs.
    Instead an additional usage id to set "maximum report latency" is defined.
    This allows host to go to sleep upto this latency period without getting
    any report. Since there is no ABI to set this latency, a new attribute
    "hwfifo_timeout" is added so that user mode can specify a latency.
    
    This change checks presence of usage id to get/set maximum report latency
    and if present, it will expose hwfifo_timeout.

    iio: hid-sensor-rotation: Add geomagnetic orientation sensor hid support.
    
    Geomagnetic orientation(AM) sensor is one kind of orientation 6dof sensor.
    It gives the device rotation in respect to the earth center and the
    magnetic north. The sensor is implemented through use of an accelerometer
    and magnetometer do not use gyroscope. It is a standard HID sensor.
    
    More information can be found in:
    http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/HUTRR59_-_Usages_for_Wearables.pdf
    
    Geomagnetic orientation(AM) sensor and dev rotation sensor have same
    channel and share channel usage id. So the most of the code for relative
    orientation sensor can be reused.

    iio: Add gravity sensor support
    
    Gravity sensor is a soft sensor, which derives value from
    standard accelerometer device by filtering out the acceleration
    which is not caused by gravity.
    
    Gravity sensor provides a three dimensional vector indicating
    the direction and magnitude of gravity. Typically, this sensor
    is used to determine the device's relative orientation in space.
    The units and the coordinate system is the same as the one used by
    the acceleration sensor.
    When a device is at rest, the output of the gravity sensor should
    be identical to that of the accelerometer.
    
    More information can be found in:
    http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/HUTRR59_-_Usages_for_Wearables.pdf
    
    Gravity sensor and accelerometer have similar channels and
    share channel usage ids. So the most of the code for accel_3d
    can be reused.

    HID: hid-sensor-hub: Add support for application collection
    
    Section 4.2.5 of HID Sensor hub specification allows two methods
    defining sensor devices.
    - Each sensor device by its own collection
    - A top level application collection object, including multiple
    sensors.
    In the first method, each sensor can be in its own sensor application
    collection without a physical collection.
    In the second method there is a usage id for collection type, which
    is defined as an application collection, with multiple physical
    collections in it. It is possible to define fusion sensor with this
    and may have its own handler. If there is a callback registered
    for the collection type, then forward all reports for sensors in
    its collection to this handler.

    iio: hid-sensor-hub: Remove hard coded indexes
    
    Remove the hard coded indexes, instead search for usage id and
    use the index to set the power and report state.
    This will fix issue, where the report descriptor doesn't contain
    the full list of possible selector for power and report state.

    Merge tag 'iio-for-3.14b' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jic23/iio into staging-next
    
    Jonathan writes:
    
    2nd round of new IIO drivers, features and cleanups for the 3.14 cycle.
    
    New drivers
    
    * HID inclinometer driver.
    
    * DHT11 humidity driver.  Note that previous humidity drivers have been in
      hwmon, but no one was ever entirely happy with that, and they should find
      a more comfortable home in IIO (their original placement in hwmon was my
      fault - oops).  As this is our first humidity driver, core support is also
      added.
    
    New features
    
    * Two of mxs-lradc channels are internally wired to a temperature sensor,
      make this explicit in the driver by providing the relevant temperature
      channel.
    
    * Add support for blocking IO on buffers.
    
    * Add a data_available call back to the interface between buffer implementations
      and the core.  This is much cleaner than the old, 'stufftoread' flag.
      Implemented in the kfifo buffer.
    
    Cleanups
    
    * Last user of the old event configuration interface is converted and the
      old interface dropped.  Nice to be rid of this thanks to Lars-Peter's hard
      work!
    
    * Replace all remaining instances of the IIO_ST macro with explicit filling
      of the scan_type structure within struct iio_chan_spec.  This macro was a
      bad idea, that rapidly ceased to cover all elements of the structure.
      Miss reading of the macro arguements has led to a number of bugs so lets
      just get rid of it. The final removal patch is awaiting for some fixes
      to make their way into mainline.
      In a couple of drivers, no elements of scan_type were even being used so
      in those case, it has been dropped entirely.
    
    * Drop a couple of of_match_ptr helper uses in drivers where devicetree is
      not optional and hence the structures being protected by this always exist.
    
    * Fix up some cases where data was read from a device in a particular
      byte order, but he code placed it into a s16 or similar.  These were
      highlighted by Sparse.
    
    * Use the new ATTRIBUTE_GROUPS macro to drop some boiler plate in the triggers
      core code.
    
    * ad7746 and ad7280a - stop storing buffers on the stack, giving cleaner code
      and possibly avoiding issues with i2c bus drivers that assume they can dma
      directly into the buffer.  Note that this cannot currently happen as the the
      i2c_smbus_read_i2c_block_data function has a memcpy from the buffer actually
      passed to the bus driver.  I missed this element of the commit message
      and don't think it is major enough to rebase the iio tree.
    
    * ad5791 and ad5504 stop storing buffers on the stack for an SPI driver.
      Unlike the i2c drivers, this is a real issue for SPI drivers which can dma
      directly into the buffer supplied.

    iio: hid-sensors: Fix power and report state
    
    In the original HID sensor hub firmwares all Named array enums were
    to 0-based. But the most recent hub implemented as 1-based,
    because of the implementation by one of the major OS vendor.
    Using logical minimum for the field as the base of enum. So we add
    logical minimum to the selector values before setting those fields.
    Some sensor hub FWs already changed logical minimum from 0 to 1
    to reflect this and hope every other vendor will follow.
    There is no easy way to add a common HID quirk for NAry elements,
    even if the standard specifies these field as NAry, the collection
    used to describe selectors is still just "logical".

    It should not be necessary to add IDs for HID sensor hubs to lists in
    hid-core.c and hid-sensor-hub.c. So instead of a whitelist, autodetect such USB
    HID sensor hubs, based on a collection of type physical inside a useage page of
    type sensor. If some sensor hubs stil must be usable as raw devices, a
    blacklist might be created.

    HID: sensors: introduce sensor framework
    
    Adding processing for HID Sensor usage table as defined by
    HID 1.12, Request #: HUTRR39, dated 05 May, 2011.
    This driver uses HID driver framework to register, send and
    receive events.
    This uses MFD framework, so that actual processing for a
    specific usage id can be done in a different driver. For
    example an accelerometer driver can be a separate driver and
    use the interface provided by this driver to register for
    events.
