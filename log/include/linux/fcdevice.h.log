    [networking]device.h: Remove extern from function prototypes
    
    There are a mix of function prototypes with and without extern
    in the kernel sources.  Standardize on not using extern for
    function prototypes.
    
    Function prototypes don't need to be written with extern.
    extern is assumed by the compiler.  Its use is as unnecessary as
    using auto to declare automatic/local variables in a block.

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
