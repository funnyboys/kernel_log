    dmabuf: use spinlock to access dmabuf->name
    
    There exists a sleep-while-atomic bug while accessing the dmabuf->name
    under mutex in the dmabuffs_dname(). This is caused from the SELinux
    permissions checks on a process where it tries to validate the inherited
    files from fork() by traversing them through iterate_fd() (which
    traverse files under spin_lock) and call
    match_file(security/selinux/hooks.c) where the permission checks happen.
    This audit information is logged using dump_common_audit_data() where it
    calls d_path() to get the file path name. If the file check happen on
    the dmabuf's fd, then it ends up in ->dmabuffs_dname() and use mutex to
    access dmabuf->name. The flow will be like below:
    flush_unauthorized_files()
      iterate_fd()
        spin_lock() --> Start of the atomic section.
          match_file()
            file_has_perm()
              avc_has_perm()
                avc_audit()
                  slow_avc_audit()
                    common_lsm_audit()
                      dump_common_audit_data()
                        audit_log_d_path()
                          d_path()
                            dmabuffs_dname()
                              mutex_lock()--> Sleep while atomic.
    
    Call trace captured (on 4.19 kernels) is below:
    ___might_sleep+0x204/0x208
    __might_sleep+0x50/0x88
    __mutex_lock_common+0x5c/0x1068
    __mutex_lock_common+0x5c/0x1068
    mutex_lock_nested+0x40/0x50

    d_path+0x84/0x290

    load_elf_binary+0x3a4/0x14e0
    search_binary_handler+0xb0/0x1e0
    
    So, use spinlock to access dmabuf->name to avoid sleep-while-atomic.

    dma-buf: drop dynamic_mapping flag
    
    Instead use the pin() callback to detect dynamic DMA-buf handling.
    Since amdgpu is now migrated it doesn't make much sense to keep

    dma-buf: add dynamic DMA-buf handling v15
    
    On the exporter side we add optional explicit pinning callbacks. Which are
    called when the importer doesn't implement dynamic handling, move notification
    or need the DMA-buf locked in place for its use case.
    
    On the importer side we add an optional move_notify callback. This callback is
    used by the exporter to inform the importers that their mappings should be
    destroyed as soon as possible.
    
    This allows the exporter to provide the mappings without the need to pin
    the backing store.
    
    v2: don't try to invalidate mappings when the callback is NULL,
        lock the reservation obj while using the attachments,
        add helper to set the callback
    v3: move flag for invalidation support into the DMA-buf,
        use new attach_info structure to set the callback
    v4: use importer_priv field instead of mangling exporter priv.
    v5: drop invalidation_supported flag
    v6: squash together with pin/unpin changes
    v7: pin/unpin takes an attachment now
    v8: nuke dma_buf_attachment_(map|unmap)_locked,
        everything is now handled backward compatible
    v9: always cache when export/importer don't agree on dynamic handling
    v10: minimal style cleanup
    v11: drop automatically re-entry avoidance
    v12: rename callback to move_notify
    v13: add might_lock in appropriate places
    v14: rebase on separated locking change
    v15: add EXPERIMENTAL flag, some more code comments

    dma-buf: Drop dma_buf_k(un)map
    
    It's unused.
    
    10 years ago, back when 32bit was still fairly common and trying to
    not exhaust vmalloc space sounded like a worthwhile goal, adding these
    to dma_buf made sense.
    
    Reality is that they simply never caught on, and nowadays everyone who
    needs plenty of buffers will run in 64bit mode anyway.
    
    Also update the docs in this area to adjust them to reality.
    
    The actual hooks in dma_buf_ops will be removed once all the
    implementations are gone.

    dma-buf: change DMA-buf locking convention v3
    
    This patch is a stripped down version of the locking changes
    necessary to support dynamic DMA-buf handling.
    
    It adds a dynamic flag for both importers as well as exporters
    so that drivers can choose if they want the reservation object
    locked or unlocked during mapping of attachments.
    
    For compatibility between drivers we cache the DMA-buf mapping
    during attaching an importer as soon as exporter/importer
    disagree on the dynamic handling.
    
    Issues and solutions we considered:
    
    - We can't change all existing drivers, and existing improters have
      strong opinions about which locks they're holding while calling
      dma_buf_attachment_map/unmap. Exporters also have strong opinions about
      which locks they can acquire in their ->map/unmap callbacks, levaing no
      room for change. The solution to avoid this was to move the
      actual map/unmap out from this call, into the attach/detach callbacks,
      and cache the mapping. This works because drivers don't call
      attach/detach from deep within their code callchains (like deep in
      memory management code called from cs/execbuf ioctl), but directly from
      the fd2handle implementation.
    
    - The caching has some troubles on some soc drivers, which set other modes
      than DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL. We can't have 2 incompatible mappings, and we
      can't re-create the mapping at _map time due to the above locking fun.
      We very carefuly step around that by only caching at attach time if the
      dynamic mode between importer/expoert mismatches.
    
    - There's been quite some discussion on dma-buf mappings which need active
      cache management, which would all break down when caching, plus we don't
      have explicit flush operations on the attachment side. The solution to
      this was to shrug and keep the current discrepancy between what the
      dma-buf docs claim and what implementations do, with the hope that the
      begin/end_cpu_access hooks are good enough and that all necessary
      flushing to keep device mappings consistent will be done there.
    
    v2: cleanup set_name merge, improve kerneldoc
    v3: update commit message, kerneldoc and cleanup _debug_show()

    dma-buf: add DMA_BUF_SET_NAME ioctls
    
    This patch adds complimentary DMA_BUF_SET_NAME  ioctls, which lets
    userspace processes attach a free-form name to each buffer.
    
    This information can be extremely helpful for tracking and accounting
    shared buffers.  For example, on Android, we know what each buffer will
    be used for at allocation time: GL, multimedia, camera, etc.  The
    userspace allocator can use DMA_BUF_SET_NAME to associate that
    information with the buffer, so we can later give developers a
    breakdown of how much memory they're allocating for graphics, camera,
    etc.

    dma-buf: Rename dma-ops to prevent conflict with kunmap_atomic macro
    
    Seeing the kunmap_atomic dma_buf_ops share the same name with a macro
    in highmem.h, the former can be aliased if any dma-buf user includes
    that header.
    
    I'm personally trying to include highmem.h inside scatterlist.h and this
    breaks the dma-buf code proper.
    
    Christoph Hellwig suggested [1] renaming it and pushing this patch ASAP.
    
    To maintain consistency I've renamed all four of kmap* and kunmap* to be
    map* and unmap*. (Even though only kmap_atomic presently conflicts.)

    dma-buf: use preferred struct reference in kernel-doc
    
    sed -e 's/\( \* .*\)struct &\([_a-z]*\)/\1\&struct \2/' -i
    
    Originally I wasnt a friend of this style because I thought a
    line-break between the "&struct" and "foo" part would break it. But a

    dma-buf: Update cpu access documentation
    
    - Again move the information relevant for driver writers next to the
      callbacks.
    - Put the overview and userspace interface documentation into a DOC:
      section within the code.
    - Remove the text that mmap needs to be coherent - since the
      DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC landed that's no longer the case. But keep the text
      that for pte zapping exporters need to adjust the address space.
    - Add a FIXME that kmap and the new begin/end stuff used by the SYNC
      ioctl don't really mix correctly. That's something I just realized
      while doing this doc rework.
    - Augment function and structure docs like usual.

    dma-buf: Reorganize device dma access docs
    
    - Put the initial overview for dma-buf into dma-buf.rst.
    - Put all the comments about detailed semantics into the right
      kernel-doc comment for functions or ops structure member.
    - To allow that detail, switch the reworked kerneldoc to inline style
      for dma_buf_ops.
    - Tie everything together into a much more streamlined overview
      comment, relying on the hyperlinks for all the details.
    - Also sprinkle some links into the kerneldoc for dma_buf and
      dma_buf_attachment to tie it all together.

    dma-buf: Rename struct fence to dma_fence
    
    I plan to usurp the short name of struct fence for a core kernel struct,
    and so I need to rename the specialised fence/timeline for DMA
    operations to make room.
    
    A consensus was reached in
    https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2016-July/113083.html
    that making clear this fence applies to DMA operations was a good thing.
    Since then the patch has grown a bit as usage increases, so hopefully it
    remains a good thing!
    
    (v2...: rebase, rerun spatch)
    v3: Compile on msm, spotted a manual fixup that I broke.
    v4: Try again for msm, sorry Daniel

    dma-buf: remove dma_buf_debugfs_create_file()
    
    There is only a single user of dma_buf_debugfs_create_file() and that
    one got the function pointer cast wrong. With that one fixed, there is
    no need to have a wrapper for debugfs_create_file(), just call it
    directly.
    
    With no users left, we can remove dma_buf_debugfs_create_file().
    
    While at it, simplify the error handling in dma_buf_init_debugfs()
    slightly.

    dma-buf: headerdoc fixes
    
    Apparently nobody noticed that dma-buf.h wasn't actually pulled into
    docbook build.  And as a result the headerdoc comments bitrot a bit.
    Add missing params/fields.

    dma-buf, drm, ion: Propagate error code from dma_buf_start_cpu_access()
    
    Drivers, especially i915.ko, can fail during the initial migration of a
    dma-buf for CPU access. However, the error code from the driver was not
    being propagated back to ioctl and so userspace was blissfully ignorant
    of the failure. Rendering corruption ensues.
    
    Whilst fixing the ioctl to return the error code from
    dma_buf_start_cpu_access(), also do the same for
    dma_buf_end_cpu_access().  For most drivers, dma_buf_end_cpu_access()
    cannot fail. i915.ko however, as most drivers would, wants to avoid being
    uninterruptible (as would be required to guarrantee no failure when
    flushing the buffer to the device). As userspace already has to handle
    errors from the SYNC_IOCTL, take advantage of this to be able to restart
    the syscall across signals.
    
    This fixes a coherency issue for i915.ko as well as reducing the
    uninterruptible hold upon its BKL, the struct_mutex.

    dma-buf: Remove range-based flush
    
    This patch removes range-based information used for optimizations in
    begin_cpu_access and end_cpu_access.
    
    We don't have any user nor implementation using range-based flush. It seems a
    consensus that if we ever want something like that again (or even more robust
    using 2D, 3D sub-range regions) we can use the upcoming dma-buf sync ioctl for
    such.

    dma-buf: add ref counting for module as exporter
    
    Add reference counting on a kernel module that exports dma-buf and
    implements its operations. This prevents the module from being unloaded
    while DMABUF file is in use.
    
    The original patch [1] was submitted by Tomasz Stanislawski, but this
    is a simpler way to do it.
    
    v3: call module_put() as late as possible, per gregkh's comment.
    v2: move owner to struct dma_buf, and use DEFINE_DMA_BUF_EXPORT_INFO
        macro to simplify the change.

    dma-buf: cleanup dma_buf_export() to make it easily extensible
    
    At present, dma_buf_export() takes a series of parameters, which
    makes it difficult to add any new parameters for exporters, if required.
    
    Make it simpler by moving all these parameters into a struct, and pass
    the struct * as parameter to dma_buf_export().
    
    While at it, unite dma_buf_export_named() with dma_buf_export(), and
    change all callers accordingly.

    dma-buf: update debugfs output
    
    Russell King observed 'wierd' looking output from debugfs, and also suggested
    better ways of getting device names (use KBUILD_MODNAME, dev_name())
    
    This patch addresses these issues to make the debugfs output correct and better
    looking.
    
    While at it, replace seq_printf with seq_puts to remove the checkpatch.pl

    dma-buf: replace dma_buf_export() with dma_buf_export_named()
    
    For debugging purposes, it is useful to have a name-string added
    while exporting buffers. Hence, dma_buf_export() is replaced with
    dma_buf_export_named(), which additionally takes 'exp_name' as a
    parameter.
    
    For backward compatibility, and for lazy exporters who don't wish to
    name themselves, a #define dma_buf_export() is also made available,
    which adds a __FILE__ instead of 'exp_name'.

    dma-buf: implement vmap refcounting in the interface logic
    
    All drivers which implement this need to have some sort of refcount to
    allow concurrent vmap usage. Hence implement this in the dma-buf core.
    
    To protect against concurrent calls we need a lock, which potentially
    causes new funny locking inversions. But this shouldn't be a problem
    for exporters with statically allocated backing storage, and more
    dynamic drivers have decent issues already anyway.
    
    Inspired by some refactoring patches from Aaron Plattner, who
    implemented the same idea, but only for drm/prime drivers.
    
    v2: Check in dma_buf_release that no dangling vmaps are left.
    Suggested by Aaron Plattner. We might want to do similar checks for
    attachments, but that's for another patch. Also fix up ERR_PTR return
    for vmap.
    
    v3: Check whether the passed-in vmap address matches with the cached
    one for vunmap. Eventually we might want to remove that parameter -
    compared to the kmap functions there's no need for the vaddr for
    unmapping.  Suggested by Chris Wilson.
    
    v4: Fix a brown-paper-bag bug spotted by Aaron Plattner.

    dma-buf: mmap support
    
    Compared to Rob Clark's RFC I've ditched the prepare/finish hooks
    and corresponding ioctls on the dma_buf file. The major reason for
    that is that many people seem to be under the impression that this is
    also for synchronization with outstanding asynchronous processsing.
    I'm pretty massively opposed to this because:
    
    - It boils down reinventing a new rather general-purpose userspace
      synchronization interface. If we look at things like futexes, this
      is hard to get right.
    - Furthermore a lot of kernel code has to interact with this
      synchronization primitive. This smells a look like the dri1 hw_lock,
      a horror show I prefer not to reinvent.
    - Even more fun is that multiple different subsystems would interact
      here, so we have plenty of opportunities to create funny deadlock
      scenarios.
    
    I think synchronization is a wholesale different problem from data
    sharing and should be tackled as an orthogonal problem.
    
    Now we could demand that prepare/finish may only ensure cache
    coherency (as Rob intended), but that runs up into the next problem:
    We not only need mmap support to facilitate sw-only processing nodes
    in a pipeline (without jumping through hoops by importing the dma_buf
    into some sw-access only importer), which allows for a nicer
    ION->dma-buf upgrade path for existing Android userspace. We also need
    mmap support for existing importing subsystems to support existing
    userspace libraries. And a loot of these subsystems are expected to
    export coherent userspace mappings.
    
    So prepare/finish can only ever be optional and the exporter /needs/
    to support coherent mappings. Given that mmap access is always
    somewhat fallback-y in nature I've decided to drop this optimization,
    instead of just making it optional. If we demonstrate a clear need for
    this, supported by benchmark results, we can always add it in again
    later as an optional extension.
    
    Other differences compared to Rob's RFC is the above mentioned support
    for mapping a dma-buf through facilities provided by the importer.
    Which results in mmap support no longer being optional.
    
    Note that this dma-buf mmap patch does _not_ support every possible
    insanity an existing subsystem could pull of with mmap: Because it
    does not allow to intercept pagefaults and shoot down ptes importing
    subsystems can't add some magic of their own at these points (e.g. to
    automatically synchronize with outstanding rendering or set up some
    special resources). I've done a cursory read through a few mmap
    implementions of various subsytems and I'm hopeful that we can avoid
    this (and the complexity it'd bring with it).
    
    Additonally I've extended the documentation a bit to explain the hows
    and whys of this mmap extension.
    
    In case we ever want to add support for explicitly cache maneged
    userspace mmap with a prepare/finish ioctl pair, we could specify that
    userspace needs to mmap a different part of the dma_buf, e.g. the
    range starting at dma_buf->size up to dma_buf->size*2. This works
    because the size of a dma_buf is invariant over it's lifetime. The
    exporter would obviously need to fall back to coherent mappings for
    both ranges if a legacy clients maps the coherent range and the
    architecture cannot suppor conflicting caching policies. Also, this
    would obviously be optional and userspace needs to be able to fall
    back to coherent mappings.
    
    v2:
    - Spelling fixes from Rob Clark.
    - Compile fix for !DMA_BUF from Rob Clark.
    - Extend commit message to explain how explicitly cache managed mmap
      support could be added later.
    - Extend the documentation with implementations notes for exporters
      that need to manually fake coherency.
    
    v3:
    - dma_buf pointer initialization goof-up noticed by Rebecca Schultz
      Zavin.

commit fc13020e086bfedf2afb95c91c026d5af1f80107
Author: Daniel Vetter <daniel.vetter@ffwll.ch>

    dma-buf: add support for kernel cpu access
    
    Big differences to other contenders in the field (like ion) is
    that this also supports highmem, so we have to split up the cpu
    access from the kernel side into a prepare and a kmap step.
    
    Prepare is allowed to fail and should do everything required so that
    the kmap calls can succeed (like swapin/backing storage allocation,
    flushing, ...).
    
    More in-depth explanations will follow in the follow-up documentation
    patch.
    
    Changes in v2:
    
    - Clear up begin_cpu_access confusion noticed by Sumit Semwal.
    - Don't automatically fallback from the _atomic variants to the
      non-atomic variants. The _atomic callbacks are not allowed to
      sleep, so we want exporters to make this decision explicit. The
      function signatures are explicit, so simpler exporters can still
      use the same function for both.
    - Make the unmap functions optional. Simpler exporters with permanent
      mappings don't need to do anything at unmap time.
    
    Changes in v3:
    
    - Adjust the WARN_ON checks for the new ->ops functions as suggested
      by Rob Clark and Sumit Semwal.
    - Rebased on top of latest dma-buf-next git.
    
    Changes in v4:
    
    - Fixup a missing - in a return -EINVAL; statement.

    dma-buf: don't hold the mutex around map/unmap calls
    
    The mutex protects the attachment list and hence needs to be held
    around the callbakc to the exporters (optional) attach/detach
    functions.
    
    Holding the mutex around the map/unmap calls doesn't protect any
    dma_buf state. Exporters need to properly protect any of their own
    state anyway (to protect against calls from their own interfaces).
    So this only makes the locking messier (and lockdep easier to anger).
    
    Therefore let's just drop this.

    dma-buf: add dma_data_direction to unmap dma_buf_op
    
    Some exporters may use DMA map/unmap APIs in dma-buf ops, which require
    enum dma_data_direction for both map and unmap operations.
    
    Thus, the unmap dma_buf_op also needs to have enum dma_data_direction as
    a parameter.

    device.h: audit and cleanup users in main include dir
    
    The <linux/device.h> header includes a lot of stuff, and
    it in turn gets a lot of use just for the basic "struct device"
    which appears so often.
    
    Clean up the users as follows:
    
    1) For those headers only needing "struct device" as a pointer
    in fcn args, replace the include with exactly that.
    
    2) For headers not really using anything from device.h, simply
    delete the include altogether.
    
    3) For headers relying on getting device.h implicitly before
    being included themselves, now explicitly include device.h
    
    4) For files in which doing #1 or #2 uncovers an implicit
    dependency on some other header, fix by explicitly adding
    the required header(s).
    
    Any C files that were implicitly relying on device.h to be
    present have already been dealt with in advance.
    
    Total removals from #1 and #2: 51.  Total additions coming
    from #3: 9.  Total other implicit dependencies from #4: 7.
    
    As of 3.3-rc1, there were 110, so a net removal of 42 gives
    about a 38% reduction in device.h presence in include/*

commit d15bd7ee445d0702ad801fdaece348fdb79e6581
Author: Sumit Semwal <sumit.semwal@ti.com>
Date:   Mon Dec 26 14:53:15 2011 +0530

    dma-buf: Introduce dma buffer sharing mechanism
    
    This is the first step in defining a dma buffer sharing mechanism.
    
    A new buffer object dma_buf is added, with operations and API to allow easy
    sharing of this buffer object across devices.
    
    The framework allows:
    - creation of a buffer object, its association with a file pointer, and
       associated allocator-defined operations on that buffer. This operation is
       called the 'export' operation.
    - different devices to 'attach' themselves to this exported buffer object, to
      facilitate backing storage negotiation, using dma_buf_attach() API.
    - the exported buffer object to be shared with the other entity by asking for
       its 'file-descriptor (fd)', and sharing the fd across.
    - a received fd to get the buffer object back, where it can be accessed using
       the associated exporter-defined operations.
    - the exporter and user to share the scatterlist associated with this buffer
       object using map_dma_buf and unmap_dma_buf operations.
    
    Atleast one 'attach()' call is required to be made prior to calling the
    map_dma_buf() operation.
    
    Couple of building blocks in map_dma_buf() are added to ease introduction
    of sync'ing across exporter and users, and late allocation by the exporter.
    
    For this first version, this framework will work with certain conditions:
    - *ONLY* exporter will be allowed to mmap to userspace (outside of this
       framework - mmap is not a buffer object operation),
    - currently, *ONLY* users that do not need CPU access to the buffer are
       allowed.
    
    More details are there in the documentation patch.
    
    This is based on design suggestions from many people at the mini-summits[1],
    most notably from Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>, Rob Clark <rob@ti.com> and
    Daniel Vetter <daniel@ffwll.ch>.
    
    The implementation is inspired from proof-of-concept patch-set from
    Tomasz Stanislawski <t.stanislaws@samsung.com>, who demonstrated buffer sharing
    between two v4l2 devices. [2]
