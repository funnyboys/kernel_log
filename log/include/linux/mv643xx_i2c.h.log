commit 2f0a8df40ff008822e5570b3323c56622cd92c95

    [I2C] i2c-mv64xxx: Don't set i2c_adapter.retries
    
    I2C adapter drivers are supposed to handle retries on nack by themselves
    if they do, so there's no point in setting .retries if they don't.
    
    As this retry mechanism is going away (at least in its current form),
    clean this up now so that we don't get build failures later.

    [I2C] Split mv643xx I2C platform support
    
    The motivation for this change is to allow other chips, like the
    Marvell Orion ARM SoC family, to use the existing i2c-mv64xxx driver.
