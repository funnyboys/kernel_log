    Thou shalt remember to use 'git add' or errors shall be visited on your
    downloads and there shall be wrath from on list and much gnashing of teeth.
    
    Thou shalt remember to use git status or there shall be catcalls and much

+ * struct plat_max3100 - MAX3100 SPI UART platform data
+ * @loopback:            force MAX3100 in loopback
+ * @crystal:             1 for 3.6864 Mhz, 0 for 1.8432
+ * @max3100_hw_suspend:  MAX3100 has a shutdown pin. This is a hook
+ *                       called on suspend and resume to activate it.
+ * @poll_time:           poll time for CTS signal in ms, 0 disables (so no hw
+ *                       flow ctrl is possible but you have less CPU usage)
+ *
+ * You should use this structure in your machine description to specify
+ * how the MAX3100 is connected. Example:
+ *
+ * static struct plat_max3100 max3100_plat_data = {
+ *  .loopback = 0,
+ *  .crystal = 0,
+ *  .poll_time = 100,
+ * };
+ *
+ * static struct spi_board_info spi_board_info[] = {
+ * {
+ *  .modalias	= "max3100",
+ *  .platform_data	= &max3100_plat_data,
+ *  .irq		= IRQ_EINT12,
+ *  .max_speed_hz	= 5*1000*1000,
+ *  .chip_select	= 0,
+ * },
+ * };
