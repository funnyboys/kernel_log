    USB: add SPDX identifiers to all remaining files in drivers/usb/
    
    It's good to have SPDX identifiers in all files to make it easier to
    audit the kernel tree for correct licenses.
    
    Update the drivers/usb/ and include/linux/usb* files with the correct
    SPDX license identifier based on the license text in the file itself.
    The SPDX identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which can be used
    instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This work is based on a script and data from Thomas Gleixner, Philippe
    Ombredanne, and Kate Stewart.

    usb: phy: add a new driver for omap usb2 phy
    
    All phy related programming like enabling/disabling the clocks, powering
    on/off the phy is taken care of by this driver. It is also used for OTG
    related functionality like srp.
    
    This also includes device tree support for usb2 phy driver and
    the documentation with device tree binding information is updated.
    
    Currently writing to control module register is taken care in this
    driver which will be removed once the control module driver is in place.
