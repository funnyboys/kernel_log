    USB: add SPDX identifiers to all remaining files in drivers/usb/
    
    It's good to have SPDX identifiers in all files to make it easier to
    audit the kernel tree for correct licenses.
    
    Update the drivers/usb/ and include/linux/usb* files with the correct
    SPDX license identifier based on the license text in the file itself.
    The SPDX identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which can be used
    instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This work is based on a script and data from Thomas Gleixner, Philippe
    Ombredanne, and Kate Stewart.

    usb: gadget: m66592-udc: add function for external controller
    
    M66592 has the pin of WR0 and WR1. So, if one write-pin of CPU
    connects to the pins, we have to change the setting of FIFOSEL
    register in the controller. If we don't change the setting,
    the controller cannot send the data of odd length.

    usb: m66592-udc platform data on_chip support
    
    Convert the m66592-udc driver to use the on_chip flag
    from platform data to enable on chip behaviour instead
    of relying on CONFIG_SUPERH_BUILT_IN_M66592 ugliness.
    
    This makes the code cleaner and also allows us to support
    both external and internal m66592 with the same kernel.
    
    It also makes the Kconfig part more future proof since
    we with this patch can add support for new processors
    with on-chip m66592 without modifying the Kconfig.
    
    The patch adds a m66592 header file for platform data
    and ties in platform data to the existing m66592 devices.
