commit 7f7c548c5f652375a61c1072bac3db11f7a48326
Author: Vincent Pelletier <plr.vincent@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Oct 9 14:43:18 2018 +0000

    usb: gadget: f_fs: Add support for CCID descriptors.
    
    Nothing to remap, only check length.
    Define a minimal structure for CCID descriptor only used to check length.
    As this descriptor shares the same value as HID descriptors, keep track and
    compare current interface's class to expected HID and CCID standard values.
