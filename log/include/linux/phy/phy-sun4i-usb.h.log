commit 24fe86a617c550fb9bdc6c8bd7cf647d3955f8ba
Author: Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>
Date:   Sun Mar 29 12:50:46 2015 +0200

    phy: sun4i-usb: Add a sunxi specific function for setting squelch-detect
    
    The sunxi otg phy has a bug where it wrongly detects a high speed squelch
    when reset on the root port gets de-asserted with a lo-speed device.
    
    The workaround for this is to disable squelch detect before de-asserting
    reset, and re-enabling it after the reset de-assert is done. Add a sunxi
    specific phy function to allow the sunxi-musb glue to do this.
