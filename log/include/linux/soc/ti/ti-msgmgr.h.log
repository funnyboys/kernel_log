    mailbox: Introduce TI message manager driver
    
    Support for TI Message Manager Module. This hardware block manages a
    bunch of hardware queues meant for communication between processor
    entities.
    
    Clients sitting on top of this would manage the required protocol
    for communicating with the counterpart entities.
    
    For more details on TI Message Manager hardware block, see documentation
    that will is available here: http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/spruhy8/spruhy8.pdf
    Chapter 8.1(Message Manager)
