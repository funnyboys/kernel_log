    drivers: soc: sunxi: Introduce SoC driver to map SRAMs
    
    The Allwinner SoCs have a handful of SRAM that can be either mapped to be
    accessible by devices or the CPU.
    
    That mapping is controlled by an SRAM controller, and that mapping might
    not be set by the bootloader, for example if the device wasn't used at all,
    or if we're using solutions like the U-Boot's Falcon Boot.
    
    We could also imagine changing this at runtime for example to change the
    mapping of these SRAMs to use them for suspend/resume or runtime memory
    rate change, if that ever happens.
    
    These use cases require some API in the kernel to control that mapping,
    exported through a drivers/soc driver.
    
    This driver also implement a debugfs file that shows the SRAM found in the
    system, the current mapping and the SRAM that have been claimed by some
    drivers in the kernel.
