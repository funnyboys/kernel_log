commit 40dc166cb5dddbd36aa4ad11c03915ea538f5a61
Author: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>
Date:   Tue Mar 15 00:43:46 2011 +0100

    PM / Core: Introduce struct syscore_ops for core subsystems PM
    
    Some subsystems need to carry out suspend/resume and shutdown
    operations with one CPU on-line and interrupts disabled.  The only
    way to register such operations is to define a sysdev class and
    a sysdev specifically for this purpose which is cumbersome and
    inefficient.  Moreover, the arguments taken by sysdev suspend,
    resume and shutdown callbacks are practically never necessary.
    
    For this reason, introduce a simpler interface allowing subsystems
    to register operations to be executed very late during system suspend
    and shutdown and very early during resume in the form of
    strcut syscore_ops objects.
