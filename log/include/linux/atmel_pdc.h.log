commit 93a3ddc201c501146c896d598deb61f3abbe4ab0
Author: Andrew Victor <andrew@sanpeople.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 8 11:31:22 2007 +0100

    [ARM] 4151/1: AT91 / AVR32: Move at91_pdc.h to linux/atmel_pdc.h
    
    The Atmel AT91 and AVR32 processor architectures share many of the same
    peripherals.  The PDC (Peripheral Data Controller) registers are also
    implemented within in a number of the on-chip peripherals (eg, USART,
    MMC, SPI, SSC, etc).
    
    In a attempt not to duplicate the register definitions in each
    peripheral, or in each architecture, the at91_pdc.h header in
    asm-arm/arch-at91 and asm-avr32/arch-at32ap has been replaced with
    linux/atmel_pdc.h.
    
    The definitions have also been renamed from AT91_PDC_* to ATMEL_PDC_*,
    and the drivers updated accordingly.
    
    Original patch from Nicolas Ferre.
