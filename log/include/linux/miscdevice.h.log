    rtc/ia64: remove legacy efirtc driver
    
    There are two EFI RTC drivers, the original drivers/char/efirtc.c
    driver and the more modern drivers/rtc/rtc-efi.c.
    
    Both implement the same interface, but the new one does so
    in a more portable way.
    
    Move everything over to that one and remove the old one.

    misc: move FLASH_MINOR into miscdevice.h and fix conflicts
    
    FLASH_MINOR is used in both drivers/char/nwflash.c and
    drivers/sbus/char/flash.c with conflict minor numbers.
    
    Move all the definitions of FLASH_MINOR into miscdevice.h.
    Rename FLASH_MINOR for drivers/char/nwflash.c to NWFLASH_MINOR
    and FLASH_MINOR for drivers/sbus/char/flash.c to SBUS_FLASH_MINOR.

    misc: cleanup minor number definitions in c file into miscdevice.h
    
    HWRNG_MINOR and RNG_MISCDEV_MINOR are duplicate definitions, use
    unified HWRNG_MINOR instead and moved into miscdevice.h
    
    ANSLCD_MINOR and LCD_MINOR are duplicate definitions, use unified
    LCD_MINOR instead and moved into miscdevice.h
    
    MISCDEV_MINOR is renamed to PXA3XX_GCU_MINOR and moved into
    miscdevice.h
    
    Other definitions are just moved without any change.

    rfkill: allocate static minor
    
    udev has a feature of creating /dev/<node> device-nodes if it finds
    a devnode:<node> modalias. This allows for auto-loading of modules that
    provide the node. This requires to use a statically allocated minor
    number for misc character devices.
    
    However, rfkill uses dynamic minor numbers and prevents auto-loading
    of the module. So allocate the next static misc minor number and use
    it for rfkill.

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

commit f4660cc994e12bae60d6f49895636fba662ce0a1
Author: Stefan Hajnoczi <stefanha@redhat.com>
Date:   Wed May 10 10:19:18 2017 -0400

    vhost/vsock: use static minor number
    
    Vhost-vsock is a software device so there is no probe call that causes
    the driver to register its misc char device node.  This creates a
    chicken and egg problem: userspace applications must open
    /dev/vhost-vsock to use the driver but the file doesn't exist until the
    kernel module has been loaded.
    
    Use the devname modalias mechanism so that /dev/vhost-vsock is created
    at boot.  The vhost_vsock kernel module is automatically loaded when the
    first application opens /dev/host-vsock.
    
    Note that the "reserved for local use" range in
    Documentation/admin-guide/devices.txt is incorrect.  The userio driver
    already occupies part of that range.  I've updated the documentation
    accordingly.

    miscdevice: Add helper macro for misc device boilerplate
    
    Many modules call misc_register and misc_deregister in its module init
    and exit methods without any additional code. This ends up being
    boilerplate. This patch adds helper macro module_misc_device(), that
    replaces module_init()/ module_exit() with template functions.
    
    This patch also converts drivers to use new macro.
    
    Change since v1:
    Add device.h include in miscdevice.h as module_driver macro was not
    available from other include files in some architectures.

    Input: add userio module
    
    Debugging input devices, specifically laptop touchpads, can be tricky
    without having the physical device handy. Here we try to remedy that
    with userio. This module allows an application to connect to a character
    device provided by the kernel, and emulate any serio device. In
    combination with userspace programs that can record PS/2 devices and
    replay them through the /dev/userio device, this allows developers to
    debug driver issues on the PS/2 level with devices simply by requesting
    a recording from the user experiencing the issue without having to have
    the physical hardware in front of them.

    char: make misc_deregister a void function
    
    With well over 200+ users of this api, there are a mere 12 users that
    actually checked the return value of this function.  And all of them
    really didn't do anything with that information as the system or module
    was shutting down no matter what.
    
    So stop pretending like it matters, and just return void from
    misc_deregister().  If something goes wrong in the call, you will get a
    WARNING splat in the syslog so you know how to fix up your driver.
    Other than that, there's nothing that can go wrong.

    misc: Add attribute groups
    
    Add groups field to struct miscdevice for passing the attribute groups
    at device creation.  In this way, the driver can avoid the manual call
    of device_create_file() after the device registration, which is
    basically a racy operation, in addition to the reduction of manual
    device_remove_file() calls.

    Bluetooth: allocate static minor for vhci
    
    Commit bfacbb9 (Bluetooth: Use devname:vhci module alias for virtual HCI
    driver) added the module alias to hci_vhci module so it's possible to
    create the /dev/vhci node. However creating an alias without
    specifying the minor doesn't allow us to create the node ahead,
    triggerring module auto-load when it's first accessed.
    
    Starting with depmod from kmod 16 we started to warn if there's a
    devname alias without specifying the major and minor.
    
    Let's do the same done for uhid, kvm, fuse and others, specifying a
    fixed minor. In systems with systemd as the init the following will
    happen: on early boot systemd will call "kmod static-nodes" to read
    /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.devname and then create the nodes. When
    first accessed these "dead" nodes will trigger the module loading.

commit 8dcf94bcff5bf3b54380ae2a17b034fb3b9d58e5

    misc: Reserve minor for VFIO
    
    VFIO currently allocates it's own dynamic chardev range, reserving the
    first minor for the control part of the interface (/dev/vfio/vfio) and
    the remainder for VFIO groups (/dev/vfio/$GROUP).  This works, but it
    doesn't support auto loading.  For instance when libvirt checks for
    VFIO support it looks for /dev/vfio/vfio, which currently doesn't
    exist unless the vfio module is loaded.  By converting the control
    device to a misc driver and reserving a static minor, we can enable
    auto loading.
    
    Reserving the minor is a prerequist to that conversion.  Minor 196
    is unused by anything currently in the kernel.

    cuse: add fix minor number to /dev/cuse
    
    This allows udev (or more recently systemd-tmpfiles) to create /dev/cuse on
    boot, in the same way as /dev/fuse is currently created, and the corresponding
    module to be loaded on first access.
    
    The corresponding functionalty was introduced for fuse in commit 578454f.

    HID: uhid: allocate static minor
    
    udev has this nice feature of creating "dead" /dev/<node> device-nodes if
    it finds a devnode:<node> modalias. Once the node is accessed, the kernel
    automatically loads the module that provides the node. However, this
    requires udev to know the major:minor code to use for the node. This
    feature was introduced by:
    
      commit 578454ff7eab61d13a26b568f99a89a2c9edc881
      Author: Kay Sievers <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>
      Date:   Thu May 20 18:07:20 2010 +0200
    
          driver core: add devname module aliases to allow module on-demand auto-loading
    
    However, uhid uses dynamic minor numbers so this doesn't actually work. We
    need to load uhid to know which minor it's going to use.
    
    Hence, allocate a static minor (just like uinput does) and we're good
    to go.

    xen/mce: Add mcelog support for Xen platform
    
    When MCA error occurs, it would be handled by Xen hypervisor first,
    and then the error information would be sent to initial domain for logging.
    
    This patch gets error information from Xen hypervisor and convert
    Xen format error into Linux format mcelog. This logic is basically
    self-contained, not touching other kernel components.
    
    By using tools like mcelog tool users could read specific error information,
    like what they did under native Linux.

    It does require assigning a permanent minor number for depmod to work.

    loop: add management interface for on-demand device allocation
    
    Loop devices today have a fixed pre-allocated number of usually 8.
    The number can only be changed at module init time. To find a free
    device to use, /dev/loop%i needs to be scanned, and all devices need
    to be opened until a free one is possibly found.
    
    This adds a new /dev/loop-control device node, that allows to
    dynamically find or allocate a free device, and to add and remove loop
    devices from the running system:
     LOOP_CTL_ADD adds a specific device. Arg is the number
     of the device. It returns the device i or a negative
     error code.
    
     LOOP_CTL_REMOVE removes a specific device, Arg is the
     number the device. It returns the device i or a negative
     error code.
    
     LOOP_CTL_GET_FREE finds the next unbound device or allocates
     a new one. No arg is given. It returns the device i or a
     negative error code.
    
    The loop kernel module gets automatically loaded when
    /dev/loop-control is accessed the first time. The alias
    specified in the module, instructs udev to create this
    'dead' device node, even when the module is not loaded.
    
    Example:
     cfd = open("/dev/loop-control", O_RDWR);
    
     # add a new specific loop device

    Input: uinput - add devname alias to allow module on-demand load
    
    Recent modprobe and udev versions allow to create device nodes
    for modules which are not loaded. Only the first access will cause
    the in-kernel module loader to pull-in the module. Systems which
    never access the device node will not needlessly load the module,
    and no longer need init scripts or other facilities to unconditionally
    load it.

    misc: Fix allocation 'borrowed' by vhost_net
    
    10, 233 is allocated officially to /dev/kmview which is shipping in
    Ubuntu and Debian distributions.  vhost_net seem to have borrowed it
    without making a proper request and this causes regressions in the other
    distributions.
    
    vhost_net can use a dynamic minor so use that instead.  Also update the
    file with a comment to try and avoid future misunderstandings.

    driver core: add devname module aliases to allow module on-demand auto-loading
    
    This adds:
      alias: devname:<name>
    to some common kernel modules, which will allow the on-demand loading
    of the kernel module when the device node is accessed.
    
    Ideally all these modules would be compiled-in, but distros seems too
    much in love with their modularization that we need to cover the common
    cases with this new facility. It will allow us to remove a bunch of pretty
    useless init scripts and modprobes from init scripts.
    
    The static device node aliases will be carried in the module itself. The
    program depmod will extract this information to a file in the module directory:
      $ cat /lib/modules/2.6.34-00650-g537b60d-dirty/modules.devname
      # Device nodes to trigger on-demand module loading.
      microcode cpu/microcode c10:184
      fuse fuse c10:229
      ppp_generic ppp c108:0
      tun net/tun c10:200
      dm_mod mapper/control c10:235
    
    Udev will pick up the depmod created file on startup and create all the
    static device nodes which the kernel modules specify, so that these modules
    get automatically loaded when the device node is accessed:
      $ /sbin/udevd --debug
      ...
      static_dev_create_from_modules: mknod '/dev/cpu/microcode' c10:184
      static_dev_create_from_modules: mknod '/dev/fuse' c10:229
      static_dev_create_from_modules: mknod '/dev/ppp' c108:0
      static_dev_create_from_modules: mknod '/dev/net/tun' c10:200
      static_dev_create_from_modules: mknod '/dev/mapper/control' c10:235
      udev_rules_apply_static_dev_perms: chmod '/dev/net/tun' 0666
      udev_rules_apply_static_dev_perms: chmod '/dev/fuse' 0666
    
    A few device nodes are switched to statically allocated numbers, to allow
    the static nodes to work. This might also useful for systems which still run
    a plain static /dev, which is completely unsafe to use with any dynamic minor
    numbers.
    
    Note:
    The devname aliases must be limited to the *common* and *single*instance*
    device nodes, like the misc devices, and never be used for conceptually limited
    systems like the loop devices, which should rather get fixed properly and get a
    control node for losetup to talk to, instead of creating a random number of
    device nodes in advance, regardless if they are ever used.
    
    This facility is to hide the mess distros are creating with too modualized
    kernels, and just to hide that these modules are not compiled-in, and not to
    paper-over broken concepts. Thanks! :)

commit 3a4d5c94e959359ece6d6b55045c3f046677f55c
Author: Michael S. Tsirkin <mst@redhat.com>
Date:   Thu Jan 14 06:17:27 2010 +0000

    vhost_net: a kernel-level virtio server
    
    What it is: vhost net is a character device that can be used to reduce
    the number of system calls involved in virtio networking.
    Existing virtio net code is used in the guest without modification.
    
    There's similarity with vringfd, with some differences and reduced scope
    - uses eventfd for signalling
    - structures can be moved around in memory at any time (good for
      migration, bug work-arounds in userspace)
    - write logging is supported (good for migration)
    - support memory table and not just an offset (needed for kvm)
    
    common virtio related code has been put in a separate file vhost.c and
    can be made into a separate module if/when more backends appear.  I used
    Rusty's lguest.c as the source for developing this part : this supplied
    me with witty comments I wouldn't be able to write myself.
    
    What it is not: vhost net is not a bus, and not a generic new system
    call. No assumptions are made on how guest performs hypercalls.
    Userspace hypervisors are supported as well as kvm.
    
    How it works: Basically, we connect virtio frontend (configured by
    userspace) to a backend. The backend could be a network device, or a tap
    device.  Backend is also configured by userspace, including vlan/mac
    etc.
    
    Status: This works for me, and I haven't see any crashes.
    Compared to userspace, people reported improved latency (as I save up to
    4 system calls per packet), as well as better bandwidth and CPU
    utilization.
    
    Features that I plan to look at in the future:
    - mergeable buffers
    - zero copy
    - scalability tuning: figure out the best threading model to use
    
    Note on RCU usage (this is also documented in vhost.h, near
    private_pointer which is the value protected by this variant of RCU):
    what is happening is that the rcu_dereference() is being used in a
    workqueue item.  The role of rcu_read_lock() is taken on by the start of
    execution of the workqueue item, of rcu_read_unlock() by the end of
    execution of the workqueue item, and of synchronize_rcu() by
    flush_workqueue()/flush_work(). In the future we might need to apply
    some gcc attribute or sparse annotation to the function passed to
    INIT_WORK(). Paul's ack below is for this RCU usage.

    Driver-Core: extend devnode callbacks to provide permissions
    
    This allows subsytems to provide devtmpfs with non-default permissions
    for the device node. Instead of the default mode of 0600, null, zero,
    random, urandom, full, tty, ptmx now have a mode of 0666, which allows
    non-privileged processes to access standard device nodes in case no
    other userspace process applies the expected permissions.
    
    This also fixes a wrong assignment in pktcdvd and a checkpatch.pl complain.

    PM: Remove destroy_suspended_device()
    
    After 2.6.24 there was a plan to make the PM core acquire all device
    semaphores during a suspend/hibernation to protect itself from
    concurrent operations involving device objects.  That proved to be
    too heavy-handed and we found a better way to achieve the goal, but
    before it happened, we had introduced the functions
    device_pm_schedule_removal() and destroy_suspended_device() to allow
    drivers to "safely" destroy a suspended device and we had adapted some
    drivers to use them.  Now that these functions are no longer necessary,
    it seems reasonable to remove them and modify their users to use the
    normal device unregistration instead.

    Driver core: change misc class_devices to be real devices
    
    This also ment that some of the misc drivers had to also be fixed
    up as they were assuming the device was a class_device.

    [PATCH] mark f_ops const in the inode
    
    Mark the f_ops members of inodes as const, as well as fix the
    ripple-through this causes by places that copy this f_ops and then "do
    stuff" with it.

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
