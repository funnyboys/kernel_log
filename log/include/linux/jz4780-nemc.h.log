commit 911a88829725572820dad9a168e735c606a2fdcb
Author: Alex Smith <alex.smith@imgtec.com>
Date:   Mon Mar 9 14:29:04 2015 +0000

    memory: jz4780-nemc: driver for the NEMC on JZ4780 SoCs
    
    Add a driver for the NAND/External Memory Controller (NEMC) on JZ4780
    and later SoCs.
    
    The primary function of this driver is to configure parameters, such
    as timings, for external memory devices using data supplied in the
    device tree. Devices connected to the NEMC are represented in the DT
    as children of the NEMC node, the driver uses optional properties
    specified in these child nodes to configure the parameters of each
    bank.
