    atm: Preserve value of skb->truesize when accounting to vcc
    
    ATM accounts for in-flight TX packets in sk_wmem_alloc of the VCC on
    which they are to be sent. But it doesn't take ownership of those
    packets from the sock (if any) which originally owned them. They should
    remain owned by their actual sender until they've left the box.
    
    There's a hack in pskb_expand_head() to avoid adjusting skb->truesize
    for certain skbs, precisely to avoid messing up sk_wmem_alloc
    accounting. Ideally that hack would cover the ATM use case too, but it
    doesn't — skbs which aren't owned by any sock, for example PPP control
    frames, still get their truesize adjusted when the low-level ATM driver
    adds headroom.
    
    This has always been an issue, it seems. The truesize of a packet
    increases, and sk_wmem_alloc on the VCC goes negative. But this wasn't
    for normal traffic, only for control frames. So I think we just got away
    with it, and we probably needed to send 2GiB of LCP echo frames before
    the misaccounting would ever have caused a problem and caused
    atm_may_send() to start refusing packets.
    
    Commit 14afee4b609 ("net: convert sock.sk_wmem_alloc from atomic_t to
    refcount_t") did exactly what it was intended to do, and turned this
    mostly-theoretical problem into a real one, causing PPPoATM to fail
    immediately as sk_wmem_alloc underflows and atm_may_send() *immediately*
    starts refusing to allow new packets.
    
    The least intrusive solution to this problem is to stash the value of
    skb->truesize that was accounted to the VCC, in a new member of the
    ATM_SKB(skb) structure. Then in atm_pop_raw() subtract precisely that
    value instead of the then-current value of skb->truesize.

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    atm: add release_cb() callback to vcc
    
    The immediate use case for this is that it will allow us to ensure that a
    pppoatm queue is woken after it has to drop a packet due to the sock being
    locked.
    
    Note that 'release_cb' is called when the socket is *unlocked*. This is
    not to be confused with vcc_release() — which probably ought to be called
    vcc_close().

    atm: add owner of push() callback to atmvcc
    
    The atm is using atmvcc->push(vcc, NULL) callback to notify protocol
    that vcc will be closed and protocol must detach from it. This callback
    is usually used by protocol to decrement module usage count by module_put(),
    but it leaves small window then module is still used after module_put().
    
    Now the owner of push() callback is kept in atmvcc and
    module_put(atmvcc->owner) is called after the protocol is detached from vcc.

    Merge tag 'device-for-3.4' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/paulg/linux
    
    Pull <linux/device.h> avoidance patches from Paul Gortmaker:
     "Nearly every subsystem has some kind of header with a proto like:
    
            void foo(struct device *dev);
    
      and yet there is no reason for most of these guys to care about the
      sub fields within the device struct.  This allows us to significantly
      reduce the scope of headers including headers.  For this instance, a
      reduction of about 40% is achieved by replacing the include with the
      simple fact that the device is some kind of a struct.
    
      Unlike the much larger module.h cleanup, this one is simply two
      commits.  One to fix the implicit <linux/device.h> users, and then one
      to delete the device.h includes from the linux/include/ dir wherever
      possible."

    device.h: audit and cleanup users in main include dir
    
    The <linux/device.h> header includes a lot of stuff, and
    it in turn gets a lot of use just for the basic "struct device"
    which appears so often.
    
    Clean up the users as follows:
    
    1) For those headers only needing "struct device" as a pointer
    in fcn args, replace the include with exactly that.
    
    2) For headers not really using anything from device.h, simply
    delete the include altogether.
    
    3) For headers relying on getting device.h implicitly before
    being included themselves, now explicitly include device.h
    
    4) For files in which doing #1 or #2 uncovers an implicit
    dependency on some other header, fix by explicitly adding
    the required header(s).
    
    Any C files that were implicitly relying on device.h to be
    present have already been dealt with in advance.
    
    Total removals from #1 and #2: 51.  Total additions coming
    from #3: 9.  Total other implicit dependencies from #4: 7.
    
    As of 3.3-rc1, there were 110, so a net removal of 42 gives
    about a 38% reduction in device.h presence in include/*

    BUG: headers with BUG/BUG_ON etc. need linux/bug.h
    
    If a header file is making use of BUG, BUG_ON, BUILD_BUG_ON, or any
    other BUG variant in a static inline (i.e. not in a #define) then
    that header really should be including <linux/bug.h> and not just
    expecting it to be implicitly present.
    
    We can make this change risk-free, since if the files using these
    headers didn't have exposure to linux/bug.h already, they would have
    been causing compile failures/warnings.

    atm/solos-pci: Don't flap VCs when carrier state changes
    
    Don't flap VCs when carrier state changes; higher-level protocols
    can detect loss of connectivity and act accordingly. This is more
    consistent with how other network interfaces work.
    
    We no longer use release_vccs() so we can delete it.
    
    release_vccs() was duplicated from net/atm/common.c; make the
    corresponding function exported, since other code duplicates it
    and could leverage it if it were public.

    atm: correct sysfs 'device' link creation and parent relationships
    
    The ATM subsystem was incorrectly creating the 'device' link for ATM
    nodes in sysfs.  This led to incorrect device/parent relationships
    exposed by sysfs and udev.  Instead of rolling the 'device' link by hand
    in the generic ATM code, pass each ATM driver's bus device down to the
    sysfs code and let sysfs do this stuff correctly.

    Clients like br2684 will call register_atmdevice_notifier() to be notified of
    changes. Drivers will call atm_dev_signal_change() to notify clients like
    br2684 of the change.

    net: Make setsockopt() optlen be unsigned.
    
    This provides safety against negative optlen at the type
    level instead of depending upon (sometimes non-trivial)
    checks against this sprinkled all over the the place, in
    each and every implementation.
    
    Based upon work done by Arjan van de Ven and feedback
    from Linus Torvalds.

    atm: 32-bit ioctl compatibility
    
    We lack compat ioctl support through most of the ATM code. This patch
    deals with most of it, and I can now at least use BR2684 and PPPoATM
    with 32-bit userspace.
    
    I haven't added a .compat_ioctl method to struct atm_ioctl, because
    AFAICT none of the current users need any conversion -- so we can just
    call the ->ioctl() method in every case. I looked at br2684, clip, lec,
    mpc, pppoatm and atmtcp.
    
    In svc_compat_ioctl() the only mangling which is needed is to change
    COMPAT_ATM_ADDPARTY to ATM_ADDPARTY. Although it's defined as
            _IOW('a', ATMIOC_SPECIAL+4,struct atm_iobuf)
    it doesn't actually _take_ a struct atm_iobuf as an argument -- it takes
    a struct sockaddr_atmsvc, which _is_ the same between 32-bit and 64-bit
    code, so doesn't need conversion.
    
    Almost all of vcc_ioctl() would have been identical, so I converted that
    into a core do_vcc_ioctl() function with an 'int compat' argument.
    
    I've done the same with atm_dev_ioctl(), where there _are_ a few
    differences, but still it's relatively contained and there would
    otherwise have been a lot of duplication.
    
    I haven't done any of the actual device-specific ioctls, although I've
    added a compat_ioctl method to struct atmdev_ops.

    [PATCH] Move linux/device.h include in linux/atmdev.h to #ifdef __KERNEL__ section
    
    linux/device.h header is not included in the David Woodhouse's
    kernel-headers git tree which is used for userspace kernel headers.  Which
    results in compile errors when building iproute2.  Attached patch moves
    linux/device.h include under the #ifdef __KERNEL__ section.

    [ATM]: deregistration removes device from atm_devs list immediately
    
    atm_dev_deregister() removes device from atm_dev list immediately to
    prevent operations on a phantom device.  Decision to free device based
    only on ->refcnt  now. Remove shutdown_atm_dev() use atm_dev_deregister()
    instead.  atm_dev_deregister() also asynchronously releases all vccs
    related to device.

     - replaced __nocast uses for gfp flags with gfp_t - it gives exactly
       the same warnings as far as sparse is concerned, doesn't change
       generated code (from gcc point of view we replaced unsigned int with

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
