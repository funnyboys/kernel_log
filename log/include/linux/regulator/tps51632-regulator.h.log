commit 0c57067430a2b729bc08c92b17eb4f29d9bbfaae
Author: Laxman Dewangan <ldewangan@nvidia.com>
Date:   Sat Oct 6 20:47:46 2012 +0530

    regulator: tps51632: Add tps51632 regulator driver
    
    The TPS51632 is a driverless step down controller with
    serial control. Advanced features such as D-Cap+
    architecture with overlapping pulse support and OSR
    overshoot reduction provide fast transient response,
    lowest output capacitance and high efficiency.
    The TPS51632 supports both I2C and DVFS interfaces
    (through PWM) for dynamic control of the output voltage
    and current monitor telemetry.
    Add regulator driver for TPS51632.
