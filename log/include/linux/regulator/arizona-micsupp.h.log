commit 22161f3eb65dc29434325736c4d780908fe3bf6a
Author: Richard Fitzgerald <rf@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>
Date:   Tue Apr 18 11:43:49 2017 +0100

    regulator: arizona-micsupp: Move pdata into a separate structure
    
    In preparation for sharing this driver with Madera, move the pdata
    for the micsupp regulator out of struct arizona_pdata into a dedicated
    pdata struct for this driver. As a result the code in
    arizona_micsupp_of_get_pdata() can be made independent of struct arizona.
    
    This patch also updates the definition of struct arizona_pdata and
    the use of this pdata in mach-crag6410-module.c
