commit 7d14831e21060fbfbfe8453460ac19205f4ce1c2

    regulator: tps6507x: allow driver to use DEFDCDC{2,3}_HIGH register
    
    Acked-by: Mark Brown <broonie@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>
    
    In TPS6507x, depending on the status of DEFDCDC{2,3} pin either
    DEFDCDC{2,3}_LOW or DEFDCDC{2,3}_HIGH register needs to be read or
    programmed to change the output voltage.
    
    The current driver assumes DEFDCDC{2,3} pins are always tied low
    and thus operates only on DEFDCDC{2,3}_LOW register. This need
    not always be the case (as is found on OMAP-L138 EVM).
    
    Unfortunately, software cannot read the status of DEFDCDC{2,3} pins.
    So, this information is passed through platform data depending on
    how the board is wired.
