    regulator: pfuze100-regulator: add coin support to PF0100
    
    The driver currently supports coin cell / super cap charging, so
    this patch extends it to support PF0100.

commit c6182ac96096f35c7216e4e6a3c64c7374dadeb7
Author: George McCollister <george.mccollister@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Mar 9 08:14:43 2017 -0600

    regulator: pfuze100-regulator: add coin support
    
    Add support for PF0200 coin cell/super capacitor charger which works as
    a current limited voltage source via the LICELL pin. When VIN goes below
    a certain threshold LICELL is used to provide power for VSNVS which is
    usually used to hold up secure non-volatile storage and the real-time
    clock on the SoC.
