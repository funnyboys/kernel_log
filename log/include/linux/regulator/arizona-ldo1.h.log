commit e1739e86f0cb9c48e8745a610e6981a4e24cadad
Author: Linus Walleij <linus.walleij@linaro.org>
Date:   Mon May 14 10:06:24 2018 +0200

    regulator: arizona-ldo1: Look up a descriptor and pass to the core
    
    Instead of passing a global GPIO number, pass a descriptor looked
    up with the standard devm_gpiod_get_optional() call.
    
    We have augmented the GPIO core to look up the regulator special
    GPIO "wlf,ldoena" in commit 6a537d48461d
    "gpio: of: Support regulator nonstandard GPIO properties".

commit aaa84e6a0399df374634c42590e644a698fcc3ff
Author: Richard Fitzgerald <rf@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>
Date:   Tue Apr 18 11:43:52 2017 +0100

    regulator: arizona-ldo1: Move pdata into a separate structure
    
    In preparation for sharing this driver with Madera, move the pdata
    for the LDO1 regulator out of struct arizona_pdata into a dedicated
    pdata struct for this driver. As a result the code in
    arizona_ldo1_of_get_pdata() can be made independent of struct arizona.
    
    This patch also updates the definition of struct arizona_pdata and
    the use of this pdata in mach-crag6410-module.c
