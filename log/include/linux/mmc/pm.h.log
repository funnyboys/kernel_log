commit da68c4eb258cd9f3f0b8aeb7e46b8118bb6358b6

    sdio: introduce API for special power management features
    
    This patch series provides the core changes needed to allow SDIO cards to
    remain powered and active while the host system is suspended, and let them
    wake up the host system when needed.  This is used to implement
    wake-on-lan with SDIO wireless cards at the moment.  Patches to add that
    support to the libertas driver will be posted separately.
    
    This patch:
    
    Some SDIO cards have the ability to keep on running autonomously when the
    host system is suspended, and wake it up when needed.  This however
    requires that the host controller preserve power to the card, and
    configure itself appropriately for wake-up.
    
    There is however 4 layers of abstractions involved: the host controller
    driver, the MMC core code, the SDIO card management code, and the actual
    SDIO function driver.  To make things simple and manageable, host drivers
    must advertise their PM capabilities with a feature bitmask, then function
    drivers can query and set those features from their suspend method.  Then
    each layer in the suspend call chain is expected to act upon those bits
    accordingly.
