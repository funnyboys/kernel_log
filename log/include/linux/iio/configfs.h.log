commit 8d6c16dd7213fa43702416e3dd1059e9e36bc758
Author: Jonathan Cameron <jic23@kernel.org>
Date:   Sat Dec 5 16:23:26 2015 +0000

    iio:configfs: Introduce iio/configfs.h to provide a location for the configfs_subsystem
    
    This exported element needs to be accesible to all drivers using configfs
    within IIO.  Previously it was in the sw_trig.h file which only convered one
    such usecase.  This also fixes a sparse warning as it is now in a header
    that makes sense to include from industrialio-configfs.c
