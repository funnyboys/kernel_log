    yam: integer underflow in yam_ioctl()
    
    We cap bitrate at YAM_MAXBITRATE in yam_ioctl(), but it could also be
    negative.  I don't know the impact of using a negative bitrate but let's
    prevent it.

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
