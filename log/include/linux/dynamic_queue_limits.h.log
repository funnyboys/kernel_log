    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    locking/atomics: COCCINELLE/treewide: Convert trivial ACCESS_ONCE() patterns to READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE()
    
    Please do not apply this to mainline directly, instead please re-run the
    coccinelle script shown below and apply its output.
    
    For several reasons, it is desirable to use {READ,WRITE}_ONCE() in
    preference to ACCESS_ONCE(), and new code is expected to use one of the
    former. So far, there's been no reason to change most existing uses of
    ACCESS_ONCE(), as these aren't harmful, and changing them results in
    churn.
    
    However, for some features, the read/write distinction is critical to
    correct operation. To distinguish these cases, separate read/write
    accessors must be used. This patch migrates (most) remaining
    ACCESS_ONCE() instances to {READ,WRITE}_ONCE(), using the following
    coccinelle script:
    
    ----
    // Convert trivial ACCESS_ONCE() uses to equivalent READ_ONCE() and
    // WRITE_ONCE()

    dql: dql_queued() should write first to reduce bus transactions
    
    While doing high throughput test on a BQL enabled NIC,
    I found a very high cost in ndo_start_xmit() when accessing BQL data.
    
    It turned out the problem was caused by compiler trying to be
    smart, but involving a bad MESI transaction :
    
      0.05 │  mov    0xc0(%rax),%edi    // LOAD dql->num_queued
      0.48 │  mov    %edx,0xc8(%rax)    // STORE dql->last_obj_cnt = count
     58.23 │  add    %edx,%edi
      0.58 │  cmp    %edi,0xc4(%rax)
      0.76 │  mov    %edi,0xc0(%rax)    // STORE dql->num_queued += count
      0.72 │  js     bd8
    
    I got an incredible 10 % gain [1] by making sure cpu do not attempt
    to get the cache line in Shared mode, but directly requests for
    ownership.
    
    New code :
            mov    %edx,0xc8(%rax)  // STORE dql->last_obj_cnt = count
            add    %edx,0xc0(%rax)  // RMW   dql->num_queued += count
            mov    0xc4(%rax),%ecx  // LOAD dql->adj_limit
            mov    0xc0(%rax),%edx  // LOAD dql->num_queued
            cmp    %edx,%ecx
    
    The TX completion was running from another cpu, with high interrupts
    rate.
    
    Note that I am using barrier() as a soft hint, as mb() here could be
    too heavy cost.

    dql: Dynamic queue limits
    
    Implementation of dynamic queue limits (dql).  This is a libary which
    allows a queue limit to be dynamically managed.  The goal of dql is
    to set the queue limit, number of objects to the queue, to be minimized
    without allowing the queue to be starved.
    
    dql would be used with a queue which has these properties:
    
    1) Objects are queued up to some limit which can be expressed as a
       count of objects.
    2) Periodically a completion process executes which retires consumed
       objects.
    3) Starvation occurs when limit has been reached, all queued data has
       actually been consumed but completion processing has not yet run,
       so queuing new data is blocked.
    4) Minimizing the amount of queued data is desirable.
    
    A canonical example of such a queue would be a NIC HW transmit queue.
    
    The queue limit is dynamic, it will increase or decrease over time
    depending on the workload.  The queue limit is recalculated each time
    completion processing is done.  Increases occur when the queue is
    starved and can exponentially increase over successive intervals.
    Decreases occur when more data is being maintained in the queue than
    needed to prevent starvation.  The number of extra objects, or "slack",
    is measured over successive intervals, and to avoid hysteresis the
    limit is only reduced by the miminum slack seen over a configurable
    time period.
    
    dql API provides routines to manage the queue:
    - dql_init is called to intialize the dql structure
    - dql_reset is called to reset dynamic values
    - dql_queued called when objects are being enqueued
    - dql_avail returns availability in the queue
    - dql_completed is called when objects have be consumed in the queue
    
    Configuration consists of:
    - max_limit, maximum limit
    - min_limit, minimum limit
    - slack_hold_time, time to measure instances of slack before reducing
      queue limit

+ * Dynamic queue limits (dql) - Definitions
+ *
+ * Copyright (c) 2011, Tom Herbert <therbert@google.com>
+ *
+ * This header file contains the definitions for dynamic queue limits (dql).
+ * dql would be used in conjunction with a producer/consumer type queue
+ * (possibly a HW queue).  Such a queue would have these general properties:
+ *
+ *   1) Objects are queued up to some limit specified as number of objects.
+ *   2) Periodically a completion process executes which retires consumed
+ *      objects.
+ *   3) Starvation occurs when limit has been reached, all queued data has
+ *      actually been consumed, but completion processing has not yet run
+ *      so queuing new data is blocked.
+ *   4) Minimizing the amount of queued data is desirable.
+ *
+ * The goal of dql is to calculate the limit as the minimum number of objects
+ * needed to prevent starvation.
+ *
+ * The primary functions of dql are:
+ *    dql_queued - called when objects are enqueued to record number of objects
+ *    dql_avail - returns how many objects are available to be queued based
+ *      on the object limit and how many objects are already enqueued
+ *    dql_completed - called at completion time to indicate how many objects
+ *      were retired from the queue
+ *
+ * The dql implementation does not implement any locking for the dql data
+ * structures, the higher layer should provide this.  dql_queued should
+ * be serialized to prevent concurrent execution of the function; this
+ * is also true for  dql_completed.  However, dql_queued and dlq_completed  can
+ * be executed concurrently (i.e. they can be protected by different locks).
