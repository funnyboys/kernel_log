    u64_stats: Document writer non-preemptibility requirement
    
    The u64_stats mechanism uses sequence counters to protect against 64-bit
    values tearing on 32-bit architectures. Updating such statistics is a
    sequence counter write side critical section.
    
    Preemption must be disabled before entering this seqcount write critical
    section.  Failing to do so, the seqcount read side can preempt the write
    side section and spin for the entire scheduler tick.  If that reader
    belongs to a real-time scheduling class, it can spin forever and the
    kernel will livelock.
    
    Document this statistics update side non-preemptibility requirement.
    
    Reword the introductory paragraph to highlight u64_stats raison d'être:
    64-bit values tearing protection on 32-bit architectures. Divide
    documentation on a basis of internal design vs. usage constraints.
    
    Reword the u64_stats header file top comment to always mention "Reader"
    or "Writer" at the start of each bullet point, making it easier to
    follow which side each point is actually for.
    
    Clarify the statement "whole thing is a NOOP on 64bit arches or UP
    kernels".  For 32-bit UP kernels, preemption is always disabled for the
    statistics read side section.

 /*
- * To properly implement 64bits network statistics on 32bit and 64bit hosts,
- * we provide a synchronization point, that is a noop on 64bit or UP kernels.
+ * Protect against 64-bit values tearing on 32-bit architectures. This is
+ * typically used for statistics read/update in different subsystems.
  *
  * Key points :
- * 1) Use a seqcount on SMP 32bits, with low overhead.
- * 2) Whole thing is a noop on 64bit arches or UP kernels.
- * 3) Write side must ensure mutual exclusion or one seqcount update could
+ *
+ * -  Use a seqcount on 32-bit SMP, only disable preemption for 32-bit UP.
+ * -  The whole thing is a no-op on 64-bit architectures.
+ *
+ * Usage constraints:
+ *
+ * 1) Write side must ensure mutual exclusion, or one seqcount update could
  *    be lost, thus blocking readers forever.
- *    If this synchronization point is not a mutex, but a spinlock or
- *    spinlock_bh() or disable_bh() :
- * 3.1) Write side should not sleep.
- * 3.2) Write side should not allow preemption.
- * 3.3) If applicable, interrupts should be disabled.
  *
- * 4) If reader fetches several counters, there is no guarantee the whole values
- *    are consistent (remember point 1) : this is a noop on 64bit arches anyway)
+ * 2) Write side must disable preemption, or a seqcount reader can preempt the
+ *    writer and also spin forever.
+ *
+ * 3) Write side must use the _irqsave() variant if other writers, or a reader,
+ *    can be invoked from an IRQ context.
  *
- * 5) readers are allowed to sleep or be preempted/interrupted : They perform
- *    pure reads. But if they have to fetch many values, it's better to not allow
- *    preemptions/interruptions to avoid many retries.
+ * 4) If reader fetches several counters, there is no guarantee the whole values
+ *    are consistent w.r.t. each other (remember point #2: seqcounts are not
+ *    used for 64bit architectures).
  *
- * 6) If counter might be written by an interrupt, readers should block interrupts.
- *    (On UP, there is no seqcount_t protection, a reader allowing interrupts could
- *     read partial values)
+ * 5) Readers are allowed to sleep or be preempted/interrupted: they perform
+ *    pure reads.
  *
- * 7) For irq and softirq uses, readers can use u64_stats_fetch_begin_irq() and
- *    u64_stats_fetch_retry_irq() helpers
+ * 6) Readers must use both u64_stats_fetch_{begin,retry}_irq() if the stats
+ *    might be updated from a hardirq or softirq context (remember point #1:
+ *    seqcounts are not used for UP kernels). 32-bit UP stat readers could read
+ *    corrupted 64-bit values otherwise.

    u64_stats: provide u64_stats_t type
    
    On 64bit arches, struct u64_stats_sync is empty and provides
    no help against load/store tearing.
    
    Using READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() would be needed.
    
    But the update side would be slightly more expensive.
    
    local64_t was defined so that we could use regular adds
    in a manner which is atomic wrt IRQs.
    
    However the u64_stats infra means we do not have to use
    local64_t on 32bit arches since the syncp provides the needed
    protection.

    net: usbnet: fix potential deadlock on 32bit hosts
    
    Marek reported a LOCKDEP issue occurring on 32bit host,
    that we tracked down to the fact that usbnet could either
    run from soft or hard irqs.
    
    This patch adds u64_stats_update_begin_irqsave() and
    u64_stats_update_end_irqrestore() helpers to solve this case.

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    u64_stats: Introduce IRQs disabled helpers
    
    Introduce light versions of u64_stats helpers for context where
    either preempt or IRQs are disabled. This way we can make this library
    usable by scheduler irqtime accounting which currenty implement its
    ad-hoc version.

    tcp: fix lockdep splat in tcp_snd_una_update()
    
    tcp_snd_una_update() and tcp_rcv_nxt_update() call
    u64_stats_update_begin() either from process context or BH handler.
    
    This triggers a lockdep splat on 32bit & SMP builds.
    
    We could add u64_stats_update_begin_bh() variant but this would
    slow down 32bit builds with useless local_disable_bh() and
    local_enable_bh() pairs, since we own the socket lock at this point.
    
    I add sock_owned_by_me() helper to have proper lockdep support
    even on 64bit builds, and new u64_stats_update_begin_raw()
    and u64_stats_update_end_raw methods.

    Replace the bh safe variant with the hard irq safe variant.
    
    We need a hard irq safe variant to deal with netpoll transmitting
    packets from hard irq context, and we need it in most if not all of
    the places using the bh safe variant.
    
    Except on 32bit uni-processor the code is exactly the same so don't
    bother with a bh variant, just have a hard irq safe variant that
    everyone can use.

commit 827da44c61419f29ae3be198c342e2147f1a10cb
Author: John Stultz <john.stultz@linaro.org>

    net: Explicitly initialize u64_stats_sync structures for lockdep
    
    In order to enable lockdep on seqcount/seqlock structures, we
    must explicitly initialize any locks.
    
    The u64_stats_sync structure, uses a seqcount, and thus we need
    to introduce a u64_stats_init() function and use it to initialize
    the structure.
    
    This unfortunately adds a lot of fairly trivial initialization code
    to a number of drivers. But the benefit of ensuring correctness makes
    this worth while.
    
    Because these changes are required for lockdep to be enabled, and the
    changes are quite trivial, I've not yet split this patch out into 30-some
    separate patches, as I figured it would be better to get the various
    maintainers thoughts on how to best merge this change along with
    the seqcount lockdep enablement.
    
    Feedback would be appreciated!

    net: u64_stats_sync improvements
    
    - Add a comment about interrupts:
    
    6) If counter might be written by an interrupt, readers should block
    interrupts.
    
    - Fix a typo in sample of use.

    net: Introduce u64_stats_sync infrastructure
    
    To properly implement 64bits network statistics on 32bit or 64bit hosts,
    we provide one new type and four methods, to ease conversions.
    
    Stats producer should use following template granted it already got an
    exclusive access to counters (include/linux/u64_stats_sync.h contains
    some documentation about details)
    
        u64_stats_update_begin(&stats->syncp);
        stats->bytes64 += len;
        stats->packets64++;
        u64_stats_update_end(&stats->syncp);
    
    While a consumer should use following template to get consistent
    snapshot :
    
        u64 tbytes, tpackets;
        unsigned int start;
    
        do {
            start = u64_stats_fetch_begin(&stats->syncp);
            tbytes = stats->bytes64;
            tpackets = stats->packets64;
        } while (u64_stats_fetch_retry(&stats->lock, syncp));
    
    Suggested by David Miller, and comments courtesy of Nick Piggin.

+ * To properly implement 64bits network statistics on 32bit and 64bit hosts,
+ * we provide a synchronization point, that is a noop on 64bit or UP kernels.
+ *
+ * Key points :
+ * 1) Use a seqcount on SMP 32bits, with low overhead.
+ * 2) Whole thing is a noop on 64bit arches or UP kernels.
+ * 3) Write side must ensure mutual exclusion or one seqcount update could
+ *    be lost, thus blocking readers forever.
+ *    If this synchronization point is not a mutex, but a spinlock or
+ *    spinlock_bh() or disable_bh() :
+ * 3.1) Write side should not sleep.
+ * 3.2) Write side should not allow preemption.
+ * 3.3) If applicable, interrupts should be disabled.
+ *
+ * 4) If reader fetches several counters, there is no guarantee the whole values
+ *    are consistent (remember point 1) : this is a noop on 64bit arches anyway)
+ *
+ * 5) readers are allowed to sleep or be preempted/interrupted : They perform
+ *    pure reads. But if they have to fetch many values, it's better to not allow
+ *    preemptions/interruptions to avoid many retries.
+ *
+ * Usage :
+ *
+ * Stats producer (writer) should use following template granted it already got
+ * an exclusive access to counters (a lock is already taken, or per cpu
+ * data is used [in a non preemptable context])
+ *
