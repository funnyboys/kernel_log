commit a5c6951c49fbf7509419d877620625ca3cdae9b1

    mfd: wm97xx-core: core support for wm97xx Codec
    
    The WM9705, WM9712 and WM9713 are highly integrated codecs, with an
    audio codec, DAC and ADC, GPIO unit and a touchscreen interface.
    
    Historically the support was spread across drivers/input/touchscreen and
    sound/soc/codecs. The sharing was done through ac97 bus sharing. This
    model will not withstand the new AC97 bus model, where codecs are
    discovered on runtime.
