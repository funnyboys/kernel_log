commit 42fad570b666256a3fd009e23e74cbb365a29ca8
Author: Mark Brown <broonie@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>
Date:   Thu Sep 11 11:12:01 2008 +0100

    regulator: Add WM8400 regulator support
    
    The WM8400 provides two programmable DCDC step-down (buck) convertors
    and four low-dropout (LDO) regulators. This driver provides support for
    runtime managment of these in the standard regulator API.
    
    Support for configuration of the suspend and hibernate mode behaviour
    of the regulators is not yet included.
