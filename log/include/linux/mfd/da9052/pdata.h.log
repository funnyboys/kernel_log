    MFD: DA9052/53 MFD core module
    
    The DA9052/53 is a highly integrated PMIC subsystem with supply domain
    flexibility to support wide range of high performance application.
    
    It provides voltage regulators, GPIO controller, Touch Screen, RTC, Battery
    control and other functionality.
    
    This patch is functionally tested on Samsung SMDKV6410.
