commit 656211b1dfb9e0b68d4e634931432e29a6facf46

    mfd: Add support for DA9061
    
    MFD support for DA9061 is provided as part of the DA9062 device driver.
    
    The registers header file adds two new chip variant IDs defined in DA9061
    and DA9062 hardware. The core header file adds new software enumerations
    for listing the valid DA9061 IRQs and a da9062_compatible_types enumeration
    for distinguishing between DA9061/62 devices in software.
    
    The core source code adds a new .compatible of_device_id entry. This is
    extended from DA9062 to support both "dlg,da9061" and "dlg,da9062". The
    .data entry now holds a reference to the enumerated device type.
    
    A new regmap_irq_chip model is added for DA9061 and this supports the new
    list of regmap_irq entries. A new mfd_cell da9061_devs[] array lists the
    new sub system components for DA9061. Support is added for a new DA9061
    regmap_config which lists the correct readable, writable and volatile
    ranges for this chip.
    
    The probe function uses the device tree compatible string to switch on the
    da9062_compatible_types and configure the correct mfd cells, irq chip and
    regmap config.
    
    Kconfig is updated to reflect support for DA9061 and DA9062 PMICs.
