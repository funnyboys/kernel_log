commit c65a8b51123a14f6960e4238bfa4673d54ee183a
Author: Paul Kocialkowski <contact@paulk.fr>
Date:   Sat Sep 3 00:09:53 2016 +0200

    power: supply: bq24735-charger: Request status GPIO with initial input setup
    
    This requests the status GPIO with initial input setup. It is required
    to read the GPIO status at probe time and thus correctly avoid sending
    I2C messages when AC is not plugged.
    
    When requesting the GPIO without initial input setup, it always reads 0
    which causes probe to fail as it assumes the charger is connected, sends
    I2C messages and fails.
    
    While at it, this switches the driver over to gpiod API.

    power_supply: Add support for bq24735 charger
    
    Adds support for the bq24735 charger chipset. The bq24735 is a
    high-efficiency, synchronous battery charger.
    
    It allows control of the charging current, input current, and the charger
    voltage DAC's through SMBus.
