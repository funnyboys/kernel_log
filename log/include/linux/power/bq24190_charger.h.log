Author: Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>
Date:   Wed Aug 30 11:48:11 2017 +0200

    power: supply: bq24190_charger: Export 5V boost converter as regulator
    
    Register the 5V boost converter as a regulator named "usb_otg_vbus".
    
    This commit also adds support for bq24190_platform_data, through which
    non device-tree platforms can pass the regulator_init_data (containing
    mappings for the consumer amongst other things).

    power: supply: bq24190_charger: Use i2c-core irq-mapping code
    
    The i2c-core already maps of irqs before calling the driver's probe
    function and there are no in tree users of
    bq24190_platform_data->gpio_int.
    
    Remove the redundant custom irq-mapping code and just use client->irq.

commit d7bf353fd0aa3e12060ce64c8a7b4aaf4336145c
Author: Mark A. Greer <mgreer@animalcreek.com>

    bq24190_charger: Add support for TI BQ24190 Battery Charger
    
    Add driver support for the Texas Instruments BQ24190 battery charger.
    Some of the information provided by the device is about the charger and
    other information is about the battery so create two power_supply objects
    (one for each) and provide the appropriate information for each one.
    
    The device has many fields that go beyond what is reasonable to report or
    modify using the existing 'POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_*' properties so the driver
    exports the register fields via sysfs.  They are prefixed by 'f_' (for
    'field') to make it easier to distinguish between a register field and a
    "normal" sysfs file exported by the power_supply infrastructure.
