commit cbf9077e586b9c0db1a1ce5690552ae268c15848
Author: Chris Lapa <chris@lapa.com.au>
Date:   Fri Jun 24 12:26:08 2016 +1000

    max8903: cleans up confusing relationship between dc_valid, dok and dcm.
    
    The max8903_charger.h file indicated that dcm and dok were not optional
    when dc_valid is set.
    
    It makes sense to have dok as a compulsory pin when dc_valid is given.
    However dcm can be optionally wired to a fixed level especially when the
    circuit is configured for dc power exclusively.
    
    The previous implementation already allowed for this somewhat, however no
    error was given if dok wasn't given whilst dc_valid was.
    
    The new implementation enforces dok presence when dc_valid is given. Whilst
    allowing dcm to be optional.

    power_supply: Add driver for MAX8903 charger
    
    MAX8903 is an integrated battery charger and selector with two
    power inputs (USB and AC adapter). This driver enables the charger,
    handles interrupts, and provides power-supply-class information to
    userland.
    
    Tested on Exynos4 NURI / S5PC210 SLP7 boards.
