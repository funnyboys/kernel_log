    ARM: mvebu: extend PMSU code to support dynamic frequency scaling
    
    This commit adds the necessary code in the Marvell EBU PMSU driver to
    support dynamic frequency scaling. In essence, what this new code does
    is that it:
    
     * registers the frequency operating points supported by the CPU;
    
     * registers a clock notifier of the CPU clocks. The notifier function
       listens to the newly introduced APPLY_RATE_CHANGE event, and uses
       that to finalize the frequency transition by doing the part of the
       procedure that involves the PMSU;
    
     * registers a platform device for the cpufreq-generic driver, which
       will take care of the CPU frequency transitions.
