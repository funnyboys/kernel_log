    uaccess: disallow > INT_MAX copy sizes
    
    As we've done with VFS, string operations, etc, reject usercopy sizes
    larger than INT_MAX, which would be nice to have for catching bugs
    related to size calculation overflows[1].
    
    This adds 10 bytes to x86_64 defconfig text and 1980 bytes to the data
    section:

    uaccess: add missing __must_check attributes
    
    The usercopy implementation comments describe that callers of the
    copy_*_user() family of functions must always have their return values
    checked.  This can be enforced at compile time with __must_check, so add
    it where needed.

    thread_info: Add update_thread_flag() helpers
    
    There are a number of bits of code sprinkled around the kernel to
    set a thread flag if a certain condition is true, and clear it
    otherwise.
    
    To help make those call sites terser and less cumbersome, this
    patch adds a new family of thread flag manipulators
    
            update*_thread_flag([...,] flag, cond)
    
    which do the equivalent of:
    
            if (cond)
                    set*_thread_flag([...,] flag);
            else
                    clear*_thread_flag([...,] flag);

    fork: unconditionally clear stack on fork
    
    One of the classes of kernel stack content leaks[1] is exposing the
    contents of prior heap or stack contents when a new process stack is
    allocated.  Normally, those stacks are not zeroed, and the old contents
    remain in place.  In the face of stack content exposure flaws, those
    contents can leak to userspace.
    
    Fixing this will make the kernel no longer vulnerable to these flaws, as
    the stack will be wiped each time a stack is assigned to a new process.
    There's not a meaningful change in runtime performance; it almost looks
    like it provides a benefit.
    
    Performing back-to-back kernel builds before:
            Run times: 157.86 157.09 158.90 160.94 160.80
            Mean: 159.12
            Std Dev: 1.54
    
    and after:
            Run times: 159.31 157.34 156.71 158.15 160.81
            Mean: 158.46
            Std Dev: 1.46
    
    Instead of making this a build or runtime config, Andy Lutomirski
    recommended this just be enabled by default.
    
    [1] A noisy search for many kinds of stack content leaks can be seen here:
    https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=linux+kernel+stack+leak
    
    I did some more with perf and cycle counts on running 100,000 execs of
    /bin/true.
    
    before:
    Cycles: 218858861551 218853036130 214727610969 227656844122 224980542841
    Mean:  221015379122.60
    Std Dev: 4662486552.47
    
    after:
    Cycles: 213868945060 213119275204 211820169456 224426673259 225489986348
    Mean:  217745009865.40
    Std Dev: 5935559279.99
    
    It continues to look like it's faster, though the deviation is rather
    wide, but I'm not sure what I could do that would be less noisy.  I'm
    open to ideas!

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    fork: allow arch-override of VMAP stack alignment
    
    In some cases, an architecture might wish its stacks to be aligned to a
    boundary larger than THREAD_SIZE. For example, using an alignment of
    double THREAD_SIZE can allow for stack overflows smaller than
    THREAD_SIZE to be detected by checking a single bit of the stack
    pointer.
    
    This patch allows architectures to override the alignment of VMAP'd
    stacks, by defining THREAD_ALIGN. Where not defined, this defaults to
    THREAD_SIZE, as is the case today.

    x86/arch_prctl: Add ARCH_[GET|SET]_CPUID
    
    Intel supports faulting on the CPUID instruction beginning with Ivy Bridge.
    When enabled, the processor will fault on attempts to execute the CPUID
    instruction with CPL>0. Exposing this feature to userspace will allow a
    ptracer to trap and emulate the CPUID instruction.
    
    When supported, this feature is controlled by toggling bit 0 of
    MSR_MISC_FEATURES_ENABLES. It is documented in detail in Section 2.3.2 of
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=243991
    
    Implement a new pair of arch_prctls, available on both x86-32 and x86-64.
    
    ARCH_GET_CPUID: Returns the current CPUID state, either 0 if CPUID faulting
        is enabled (and thus the CPUID instruction is not available) or 1 if
        CPUID faulting is not enabled.
    
    ARCH_SET_CPUID: Set the CPUID state to the second argument. If
        cpuid_enabled is 0 CPUID faulting will be activated, otherwise it will
        be deactivated. Returns ENODEV if CPUID faulting is not supported on
        this system.
    
    The state of the CPUID faulting flag is propagated across forks, but reset
    upon exec.

    thread_info: include <current.h> for THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK
    
    When CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK is selected, the current_thread_info()
    macro relies on current having been defined prior to its use. However,
    not all users of current_thread_info() include <asm/current.h>, and thus
    current is not guaranteed to be defined.
    
    When CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK is not selected, it's possible that
    get_current() / current are based upon current_thread_info(), and
    <asm/current.h> includes <asm/thread_info.h>. Thus always including
    <asm/current.h> would result in circular dependences on some platforms.
    
    To ensure both cases work, this patch includes <asm/current.h>, but only
    when CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK is selected.

    thread_info: factor out restart_block
    
    Since commit f56141e3e2d9aabf ("all arches, signal: move restart_block
    to struct task_struct"), thread_info and restart_block have been
    logically distinct, yet struct restart_block is still defined in
    <linux/thread_info.h>.
    
    At least one architecture (erroneously) uses restart_block as part of
    its thread_info, and thus the definition of restart_block must come
    before the include of <asm/thread_info>. Subsequent patches in this
    series need to shuffle the order of includes and definitions in
    <linux/thread_info.h>, and will make this ordering fragile.
    
    This patch moves the definition of restart_block out to its own header.
    This serves as generic cleanup, logically separating thread_info and
    restart_block, and also makes it easier to avoid fragility.

    sched/core, x86: Make struct thread_info arch specific again
    
    The following commit:
    
      c65eacbe290b ("sched/core: Allow putting thread_info into task_struct")
    
    ... made 'struct thread_info' a generic struct with only a
    single ::flags member, if CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK_STRUCT=y is
    selected.
    
    This change however seems to be quite x86 centric, since at least the
    generic preemption code (asm-generic/preempt.h) assumes that struct
    thread_info also has a preempt_count member, which apparently was not
    true for x86.
    
    We could add a bit more #ifdefs to solve this problem too, but it seems
    to be much simpler to make struct thread_info arch specific
    again. This also makes the conversion to THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK_STRUCT a
    bit easier for architectures that have a couple of arch specific stuff
    in their thread_info definition.
    
    The arch specific stuff _could_ be moved to thread_struct. However
    keeping them in thread_info makes it easier: accessing thread_info
    members is simple, since it is at the beginning of the task_struct,
    while the thread_struct is at the end. At least on s390 the offsets
    needed to access members of the thread_struct (with task_struct as
    base) are too large for various asm instructions.  This is not a
    problem when keeping these members within thread_info.

    thread_info: Use unsigned long for flags
    
    The generic THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK definition of thread_info::flags is a
    u32, matching x86 prior to the introduction of THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK.
    
    However, common helpers like test_ti_thread_flag() implicitly assume
    that thread_info::flags has at least the size and alignment of unsigned
    long, and relying on padding and alignment provided by other elements of
    task_struct is somewhat fragile. Additionally, some architectures use
    more that 32 bits for thread_info::flags, and others may need to in
    future.
    
    With THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK, task struct follows thread_info with a long
    field, and thus we no longer save any space as we did back in commit:
    
      affa219b60a11b32 ("x86: change thread_info's flag field back to 32 bits")
    
    Given all this, it makes more sense for the generic thread_info::flags
    to be an unsigned long.
    
    In fact given <linux/thread_info.h> contains/uses the helpers mentioned
    above, BE arches *must* use unsigned long (or something of the same size)
    today, or they wouldn't work.
    
    Make it so.

    sched/core: Allow putting thread_info into task_struct
    
    If an arch opts in by setting CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK_STRUCT,
    then thread_info is defined as a single 'u32 flags' and is the first
    entry of task_struct.  thread_info::task is removed (it serves no
    purpose if thread_info is embedded in task_struct), and
    thread_info::cpu gets its own slot in task_struct.
    
    This is heavily based on a patch written by Linus.

    usercopy: fold builtin_const check into inline function
    
    Instead of having each caller of check_object_size() need to remember to
    check for a const size parameter, move the check into check_object_size()
    itself. This actually matches the original implementation in PaX, though
    this commit cleans up the now-redundant builtin_const() calls in the
    various architectures.

    signal: consolidate {TS,TLF}_RESTORE_SIGMASK code
    
    In general, there's no need for the "restore sigmask" flag to live in
    ti->flags.  alpha, ia64, microblaze, powerpc, sh, sparc (64-bit only),
    tile, and x86 use essentially identical alternative implementations,
    placing the flag in ti->status.
    
    Replace those optimized implementations with an equally good common
    implementation that stores it in a bitfield in struct task_struct and
    drop the custom implementations.
    
    Additional architectures can opt in by removing their
    TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK defines.

    mm: Hardened usercopy
    
    This is the start of porting PAX_USERCOPY into the mainline kernel. This
    is the first set of features, controlled by CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY. The
    work is based on code by PaX Team and Brad Spengler, and an earlier port
    from Casey Schaufler. Additional non-slab page tests are from Rik van Riel.
    
    This patch contains the logic for validating several conditions when
    performing copy_to_user() and copy_from_user() on the kernel object
    being copied to/from:
    - address range doesn't wrap around
    - address range isn't NULL or zero-allocated (with a non-zero copy size)
    - if on the slab allocator:
      - object size must be less than or equal to copy size (when check is
        implemented in the allocator, which appear in subsequent patches)
    - otherwise, object must not span page allocations (excepting Reserved
      and CMA ranges)
    - if on the stack
      - object must not extend before/after the current process stack
      - object must be contained by a valid stack frame (when there is
        arch/build support for identifying stack frames)
    - object must not overlap with kernel text

    kmemcg: account certain kmem allocations to memcg
    
    Mark those kmem allocations that are known to be easily triggered from
    userspace as __GFP_ACCOUNT/SLAB_ACCOUNT, which makes them accounted to
    memcg.  For the list, see below:
    
     - threadinfo
     - task_struct
     - task_delay_info
     - pid
     - cred
     - mm_struct
     - vm_area_struct and vm_region (nommu)
     - anon_vma and anon_vma_chain
     - signal_struct
     - sighand_struct
     - fs_struct
     - files_struct
     - fdtable and fdtable->full_fds_bits
     - dentry and external_name
     - inode for all filesystems. This is the most tedious part, because
       most filesystems overwrite the alloc_inode method.
    
    The list is far from complete, so feel free to add more objects.
    Nevertheless, it should be close to "account everything" approach and
    keep most workloads within bounds.  Malevolent users will be able to
    breach the limit, but this was possible even with the former "account
    everything" approach (simply because it did not account everything in
    fact).

    mm: get rid of __GFP_KMEMCG
    
    Currently to allocate a page that should be charged to kmemcg (e.g.
    threadinfo), we pass __GFP_KMEMCG flag to the page allocator.  The page
    allocated is then to be freed by free_memcg_kmem_pages.  Apart from
    looking asymmetrical, this also requires intrusion to the general
    allocation path.  So let's introduce separate functions that will
    alloc/free pages charged to kmemcg.
    
    The new functions are called alloc_kmem_pages and free_kmem_pages.  They
    should be used when the caller actually would like to use kmalloc, but
    has to fall back to the page allocator for the allocation is large.
    They only differ from alloc_pages and free_pages in that besides
    allocating or freeing pages they also charge them to the kmem resource
    counter of the current memory cgroup.

    sched, idle: Fix the idle polling state logic
    
    Mike reported that commit 7d1a9417 ("x86: Use generic idle loop")
    regressed several workloads and caused excessive reschedule
    interrupts.
    
    The patch in question failed to notice that the x86 code had an
    inverted sense of the polling state versus the new generic code (x86:
    default polling, generic: default !polling).
    
    Fix the two prominent x86 mwait based idle drivers and introduce a few
    new generic polling helpers (fixing the wrong smp_mb__after_clear_bit
    usage).
    
    Also switch the idle routines to using tif_need_resched() which is an
    immediate TIF_NEED_RESCHED test as opposed to need_resched which will
    end up being slightly different.

    fork: protect architectures where THREAD_SIZE >= PAGE_SIZE against fork bombs
    
    Because those architectures will draw their stacks directly from the page
    allocator, rather than the slab cache, we can directly pass __GFP_KMEMCG
    flag, and issue the corresponding free_pages.
    
    This code path is taken when the architecture doesn't define
    CONFIG_ARCH_THREAD_INFO_ALLOCATOR (only ia64 seems to), and has
    THREAD_SIZE >= PAGE_SIZE.  Luckily, most - if not all - of the remaining
    architectures fall in this category.
    
    This will guarantee that every stack page is accounted to the memcg the
    process currently lives on, and will have the allocations to fail if they
    go over limit.
    
    For the time being, I am defining a new variant of THREADINFO_GFP, not to
    mess with the other path.  Once the slab is also tracked by memcg, we can
    get rid of that flag.

    futex: add requeue_pi functionality
    
    PI Futexes and their underlying rt_mutex cannot be left ownerless if
    there are pending waiters as this will break the PI boosting logic, so
    the standard requeue commands aren't sufficient.  The new commands
    properly manage pi futex ownership by ensuring a futex with waiters
    has an owner at all times.  This will allow glibc to properly handle
    pi mutexes with pthread_condvars.
    
    The approach taken here is to create two new futex op codes:
    
    FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI:
    Tasks will use this op code to wait on a futex (such as a non-pi waitqueue)
    and wake after they have been requeued to a pi futex.  Prior to returning to
    userspace, they will acquire this pi futex (and the underlying rt_mutex).
    
    futex_wait_requeue_pi() is the result of a high speed collision between
    futex_wait() and futex_lock_pi() (with the first part of futex_lock_pi() being
    done by futex_proxy_trylock_atomic() on behalf of the top_waiter).
    
    FUTEX_REQUEUE_PI (and FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE_PI):
    This call must be used to wake tasks waiting with FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI,
    regardless of how many tasks the caller intends to wake or requeue.
    pthread_cond_broadcast() should call this with nr_wake=1 and
    nr_requeue=INT_MAX.  pthread_cond_signal() should call this with nr_wake=1 and
    nr_requeue=0.  The reason being we need both callers to get the benefit of the
    futex_proxy_trylock_atomic() routine.  futex_requeue() also enqueues the
    top_waiter on the rt_mutex via rt_mutex_start_proxy_lock().

    with hrtimer poll/select, the signal restart data no longer is a single
    long representing a jiffies count, but it becomes a second/nanosecond pair
    that also needs to encode if there was a timeout at all or not.

    signals: set_restore_sigmask TIF_SIGPENDING
    
    Set TIF_SIGPENDING in set_restore_sigmask.  This lets arch code take
    TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK out of the set of bits that will be noticed on return to
    user mode.  On some machines those bits are scarce, and we can free this
    unneeded one up for other uses.
    
    It is probably the case that TIF_SIGPENDING is always set anyway everywhere
    set_restore_sigmask() is used.  But this is some cheap paranoia in case there
    is an arcane case where it might not be.

    This requires two new futex OPs: FUTEX_WAIT_BITS and FUTEX_WAKE_BITS
    These OPs are basically the same as FUTEX_WAIT and FUTEX_WAKE plus an
    additional argument - a bitset. Further the FUTEX_WAIT_BITS OP is
    expecting an absolute timeout value instead of the relative one, which
    is used for the FUTEX_WAIT OP.
    
    FUTEX_WAIT_BITS calls into the kernel with a bitset. The bitset is
    stored in the futex_q structure, which is used to enqueue the waiter
    into the hashed futex waitqueue.
    
    FUTEX_WAKE_BITS also calls into the kernel with a bitset. The wakeup
    function logically ANDs the bitset with the bitset stored in each
    waiters futex_q structure. If the result is zero (i.e. none of the set
    bits in the bitsets is matching), then the waiter is not woken up. If
    the result is not zero (i.e. one of the set bits in the bitsets is
    matching), then the waiter is woken.
    
    The bitset provided by the caller must be non zero. In case the
    provided bitset is zero the kernel returns EINVAL.
    
    Internaly the new OPs are only extensions to the existing FUTEX_WAIT
    and FUTEX_WAKE functions. The existing OPs hand a bitset with all bits
    set into the futex_wait() and futex_wake() functions.

    futex: fix for futex_wait signal stack corruption
    
    David Holmes found a bug in the -rt tree with respect to
    pthread_cond_timedwait. After trying his test program on the latest git
    from mainline, I found the bug was there too.  The bug he was seeing
    that his test program showed, was that if one were to do a "Ctrl-Z" on a
    process that was in the pthread_cond_timedwait, and then did a "bg" on
    that process, it would return with a "-ETIMEDOUT" but early. That is,
    the timer would go off early.
    
    Looking into this, I found the source of the problem. And it is a rather
    nasty bug at that.
    
    Here's the relevant code from kernel/futex.c: (not in order in the file)
    
    [...]
    smlinkage long sys_futex(u32 __user *uaddr, int op, u32 val,
                              struct timespec __user *utime, u32 __user *uaddr2,
                              u32 val3)
    {
            struct timespec ts;
            ktime_t t, *tp = NULL;
            u32 val2 = 0;
            int cmd = op & FUTEX_CMD_MASK;
    
            if (utime && (cmd == FUTEX_WAIT || cmd == FUTEX_LOCK_PI)) {
                    if (copy_from_user(&ts, utime, sizeof(ts)) != 0)
                            return -EFAULT;
                    if (!timespec_valid(&ts))
                            return -EINVAL;
    
                    t = timespec_to_ktime(ts);
                    if (cmd == FUTEX_WAIT)
                            t = ktime_add(ktime_get(), t);
                    tp = &t;
            }
    [...]
            return do_futex(uaddr, op, val, tp, uaddr2, val2, val3);
    }
    
    [...]
    
    long do_futex(u32 __user *uaddr, int op, u32 val, ktime_t *timeout,
                    u32 __user *uaddr2, u32 val2, u32 val3)
    {
            int ret;
            int cmd = op & FUTEX_CMD_MASK;
            struct rw_semaphore *fshared = NULL;
    
            if (!(op & FUTEX_PRIVATE_FLAG))
                    fshared = &current->mm->mmap_sem;
    
            switch (cmd) {
            case FUTEX_WAIT:
                    ret = futex_wait(uaddr, fshared, val, timeout);
    
    [...]
    
    static int futex_wait(u32 __user *uaddr, struct rw_semaphore *fshared,
                          u32 val, ktime_t *abs_time)
    {
    [...]
                   struct restart_block *restart;
                    restart = &current_thread_info()->restart_block;
                    restart->fn = futex_wait_restart;
                    restart->arg0 = (unsigned long)uaddr;
                    restart->arg1 = (unsigned long)val;
                    restart->arg2 = (unsigned long)abs_time;
                    restart->arg3 = 0;
                    if (fshared)
                            restart->arg3 |= ARG3_SHARED;
                    return -ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK;
    [...]
    
    static long futex_wait_restart(struct restart_block *restart)
    {
            u32 __user *uaddr = (u32 __user *)restart->arg0;
            u32 val = (u32)restart->arg1;
            ktime_t *abs_time = (ktime_t *)restart->arg2;
            struct rw_semaphore *fshared = NULL;
    
            restart->fn = do_no_restart_syscall;
            if (restart->arg3 & ARG3_SHARED)
                    fshared = &current->mm->mmap_sem;
            return (long)futex_wait(uaddr, fshared, val, abs_time);
    }
    
    So when the futex_wait is interrupt by a signal we break out of the
    hrtimer code and set up or return from signal. This code does not return
    back to userspace, so we set up a RESTARTBLOCK.  The bug here is that we
    save the "abs_time" which is a pointer to the stack variable "ktime_t t"
    from sys_futex.
    
    This returns and unwinds the stack before we get to call our signal. On
    return from the signal we go to futex_wait_restart, where we update all
    the parameters for futex_wait and call it. But here we have a problem
    where abs_time is no longer valid.
    
    I verified this with print statements, and sure enough, what abs_time
    was set to ends up being garbage when we get to futex_wait_restart.
    
    The solution I did to solve this (with input from Linus Torvalds)
    was to add unions to the restart_block to allow system calls to
    use the restart with specific parameters.  This way the futex code now
    saves the time in a 64bit value in the restart block instead of storing
    it on the stack.
    
    Note: I'm a bit nervious to add "linux/types.h" and use u32 and u64
    in thread_info.h, when there's a #ifdef __KERNEL__ just below that.
    Not sure what that is there for.  If this turns out to be a problem, I've
    tested this with using "unsigned int" for u32 and "unsigned long long" for
    u64 and it worked just the same. I'm using u32 and u64 just to be
    consistent with what the futex code uses.

Author: Roman Zippel <zippel@linux-m68k.org>
Date:   Sun Nov 13 16:06:59 2005 -0800

    [PATCH] m68k: convert thread flags to use bit fields
    
    Remove task_work structure, use the standard thread flags functions and use
    shifts in entry.S to test the thread flags.  Add a few local labels to entry.S
    to allow gas to generate short jumps.
    
    Finally it changes a number of inline functions in thread_info.h to macros to
    delay the current_thread_info() usage, which requires on m68k a structure
    (task_struct) not yet defined at this point.

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
