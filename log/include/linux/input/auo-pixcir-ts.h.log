commit 27cef8b47cfb27fa2955a8577637794f1f275db2
Author: Heiko Stübner <heiko@sntech.de>
Date:   Sat Feb 23 12:06:44 2013 -0800

    Input: auo-pixcir-ts - handle reset gpio directly
    
    Devicetree based platforms don't handle device callbacks very well
    and until now no board has come along that needs more extended hwinit
    than pulling the rst gpio high.
    
    Therefore pull the reset handling directly into the driver and remove
    the callbacks from the driver.
    
    If extended device setup is needed at some later point, power-sequences
    would probably be the solution of choice.

    Input: add driver for AUO In-Cell touchscreens using pixcir ICs
    
    Some displays from AUO have a so called in-cell touchscreen, meaning it
    is built directly into the display unit.
    
    Touchdata is gathered through PIXCIR Tango-ICs and processed in an
    Atmel ATmega168P with custom firmware. Communication between the host
    system and ATmega is done via I2C.
    
    Devices using this touch solution include the Dell Streak5 and the family
    of Qisda ebook readers.
    
    The driver reports single- and multi-touch events including touch area
    values.
