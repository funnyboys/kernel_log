commit ae99ea562be0a788ccb583aff21f3d2147de531f
Author: Paul Parsons <lost.distance@yahoo.com>
Date:   Thu May 10 22:11:51 2012 -0700

    Input: Add Synaptics NavPoint (PXA27x SSP/SPI) driver
    
    This driver adds support for the Synaptics NavPoint touchpad connected
    to a PXA27x SSP port in SPI slave mode. The device emulates a mouse;
    a tap or tap-and-a-half drag gesture emulates the left mouse button.
    For example, use the xf86-input-evdev driver for an X pointing device.
