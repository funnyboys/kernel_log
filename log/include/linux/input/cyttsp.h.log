commit 707b61bba8b16adb6a2cbc72b71a75e09cb0f81a
Author: Oreste Salerno <oreste.salerno@tomtom.com>
Date:   Wed Jan 27 13:55:43 2016 -0800

    Input: cyttsp - switch to using device properties
    
    Drop support for platform data passed via a C-structure and switch to
    device properties instead, which should make the driver compatible
    with all platforms: OF, ACPI and static boards. Static boards should
    use property sets to communicate device parameters to the driver.

commit 4065d1e7b2164cff4af57b58fac887df2fe75d2a
Author: Javier Martinez Canillas <javier@dowhile0.org>

    Input: add Cypress TTSP capacitive multi-touch screen support
    
    Cypress TrueTouch(tm) Standard Product controllers are found in
    a wide range of embedded devices. This driver add support for a
    variety of TTSP controllers.
    
    Since the hardware is capable of tracking identifiable contacts, multi-touch
    protocol type B (stateful) is used to report contact information.
    
    The driver is composed of a core driver that process the data sent by
    the contacts and a set of bus specific interface modules. This patch
    adds the base core TTSP driver.
