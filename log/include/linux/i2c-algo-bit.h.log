    i2c: algo: bit: add flag to whitelist atomic transfers
    
    Use the new xfer_atomic callback to check a newly introduced flag to
    whitelist atomic transfers. This will report configurations which
    worked accidently.

    i2c: export bit-banging algo functions
    
    i915 has a hw i2c controller (gmbus) but for a bunch of stupid reasons
    we need to be able to fall back to the bit-banging algo on gpio pins.
    
    The current code sets up a 2nd i2c controller for the same i2c bus using
    the bit-banging algo. This has a bunch of issues, the major one being
    that userspace can directly access this fallback i2c adaptor behind
    the drivers back.
    
    But we need to frob a few registers before and after using fallback
    gpio bit-banging, so this horribly fails.
    
    The new plan is to only set up one i2c adaptor and transparently fall
    back to bit-banging by directly calling the xfer function of the bit-
    banging algo in the i2c core.
    
    To make that possible, export the 2 i2c algo functions.
    
    v2: As suggested by Jean Delvare, simply export the i2c_bit_algo
    vtable instead of the individual functions.

commit 424ed67c7dae37e8115e1bebc3261e86a624dff2
Author: Jean Delvare <khali@linux-fr.org>
Date:   Tue May 1 23:26:33 2007 +0200

    i2c-algo-bit: Implement a 50/50 SCL duty cycle
    
    The original i2c-algo-bit implementation uses a 33/66 SCL duty cycle
    when bits are being written on the bus. While the I2C specification
    doesn't forbid it, this prevents us from driving the I2C bus to its
    max speed, limiting us to 66 kbps max on standard I2C busses.
    
    Implementing a 50/50 duty cycle instead lets us max out the bandwidth
    up to the theoretical max of 100 kbps on standard I2C busses. This is
    particularly important when large amounts of data need to be transfered
    over the bus, as is the case with some TV adapters when the firmware is
    being uploaded.
    
    In fact this change even allows, at least in theory, fast-mode I2C
    support at 125, 166 and 250 kbps. There's no way to reach the
    theoretical max of 400 kbps with this implementation. But I don't
    think we want to put efforts in that direction anyway: software-driven
    I2C is very CPU-intensive and bad for latency.
    
    Other timing changes:
    * Don't set SDA high explicitly on error, we're going to issue a stop
      condition before we leave anyway.
    * If an error occurs when sending the slave address, yield the CPU
      before retrying, and remove the additional delay after the new start
      condition.

    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
