    [PATCH] cfag12864b: fix crash when built-in and no parport present
    
    The problem comes when ks0108/cfag12864b are built-in and no parallel port is
    present.  ks0108_init() is called first, as it should be, but fails to load
    (as there is no parallel port to use).
    
    After that, cfag12864b_init() gets called, without knowing anything about
    ks0108 failed, and calls ks0108_writecontrol(), which dereferences an
    uninitialized pointer.
    
    Init order is OK, I think.  The problem is how to stop cfag12864b_init() being
    called if ks0108 failed to load.  modprobe does it for us, but, how when
    built-in?

    [PATCH] drivers: add LCD support
    
    Add support for auxiliary displays, the ks0108 LCD controller, the
    cfag12864b LCD and adds a framebuffer device: cfag12864bfb.
    
    - Add a "auxdisplay/" folder in "drivers/" for auxiliary display
      drivers.
    
    - Add support for the ks0108 LCD Controller as a device driver.  (uses
      parport interface)
    
    - Add support for the cfag12864b LCD as a device driver.  (uses ks0108
      LCD Controller driver)
    
    - Add a framebuffer device called cfag12864bfb.  (uses cfag12864b LCD
      driver)
    
    - Add the usual Documentation, includes, Makefiles, Kconfigs,
