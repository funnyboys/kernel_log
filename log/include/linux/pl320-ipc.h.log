    mailbox: rename pl320-ipc specific mailbox.h
    
    The patch 30058677 "ARM / highbank: add support for pl320 IPC"
    added a pl320 IPC specific header file as a generic mailbox.h.
    This file has been renamed appropriately to allow the
    introduction of the generic mailbox API framework.
