commit dbc049eee73004db996cc8f63754f8dd5f86d0f7

    mailbox: Add driver for Broadcom FlexRM ring manager
    
    Some of the Broadcom iProc SoCs have FlexRM ring manager
    which provides a ring-based programming interface to various
    offload engines (e.g. RAID, Crypto, etc).
    
    This patch adds a common mailbox driver for Broadcom FlexRM
    ring manager which can be shared by various offload engine
    drivers (implemented as mailbox clients).
