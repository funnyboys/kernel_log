    fpga: altera-pr-ip: Make alt_pr_unregister function void
    
    Make alt_pr_unregister function void, since it always returns 0,
    and nothing would act on the value anyways.

    fpga pr ip: Core driver support for Altera Partial Reconfiguration IP.
    
    Adding the core functions necessary for a fpga-mgr driver
    for the Altera Partial IP component.  It is intended for
    these functions to be used by the various bus implementations
    like the platform bus or the PCIe bus.
