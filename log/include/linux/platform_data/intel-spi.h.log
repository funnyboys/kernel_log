    mtd: spi-nor: intel-spi: add support for Intel Cannon Lake SPI flash
    
    Now that SPI flash controllers without a software sequencer are
    supported, it's trivial to add support for CNL and its PCI ID.

    spi-nor: Add support for Intel SPI serial flash controller
    
    Add support for the SPI serial flash host controller found on many Intel
    CPUs including Baytrail and Braswell. The SPI serial flash controller is
    used to access BIOS and other platform specific information. By default the
    driver exposes a single read-only MTD device but with a module parameter
    "writeable=1" the MTD device can be made read-write which makes it possible
    to upgrade BIOS directly from Linux.
