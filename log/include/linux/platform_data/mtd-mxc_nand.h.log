commit 82906b13a6f4f42edec92f0a3e480e1bdd9b3f91
Author: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>
Date:   Fri Aug 24 15:14:29 2012 +0200

    ARM: imx: move platform_data definitions
    
    Platform data for device drivers should be defined in
    include/linux/platform_data/*.h, not in the architecture
    and platform specific directories.
    
    This moves such data out of the imx include directories
