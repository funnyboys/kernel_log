    drm/i2c: tda9950: add CEC driver
    
    Add a CEC driver for the TDA9950, which is a stand-alone I2C CEC device,
    but is also integrated into HDMI transceivers such as the TDA9989 and
    TDA19989.
    
    The TDA9950 contains a command processor which handles retransmissions
    and the low level bus protocol.  The driver just has to read and write
    the messages, and handle error conditions.
