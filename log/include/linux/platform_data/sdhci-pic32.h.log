commit 2572f00db8a68bb46001678c1c98ad8b70e04b31
Author: Joshua Henderson <joshua.henderson@microchip.com>

    MIPS: Add support for PIC32MZDA platform
    
    This adds support for the Microchip PIC32 MIPS microcontroller with the
    specific variant PIC32MZDA. PIC32MZDA is based on the MIPS m14KEc core
    and boots using device tree.
    
    This includes an early pin setup and early clock setup needed prior to
    device tree being initialized. In additon, an interface is provided to
    synchronize access to registers shared across several peripherals.
