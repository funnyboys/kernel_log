    platform: chrome: Add cros-usbpd-notify driver
    
    ChromiumOS uses ACPI device with HID "GOOG0003" for power delivery
    related events. The existing cros-usbpd-charger driver relies on these
    events without ever actually receiving them on ACPI platforms. This is
    because in the ChromeOS kernel trees, the GOOG0003 device is owned by an
    ACPI driver that offers firmware updates to USB-C chargers.
    
    Introduce a new platform driver under cros-ec, the ChromeOS embedded
    controller, that handles these PD events and dispatches them
    appropriately over a notifier chain to all drivers that use them.
    
    On platforms that don't have the ACPI device defined, the driver gets
    instantiated for ECs which support the EC_FEATURE_USB_PD feature bit,
    and the notification events will get delivered using the MKBP event
    handling mechanism.
