commit ec2a0833e5157fab6cac5f57a49b2f31eb418a39
Author: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>
Date:   Fri Aug 24 15:11:34 2012 +0200

    ARM: davinci: move platform_data definitions
    
    Platform data for device drivers should be defined in
    include/linux/platform_data/*.h, not in the architecture
    and platform specific directories.
    
    This moves such data out of the davinci include directories
