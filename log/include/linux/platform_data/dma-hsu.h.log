    dmaengine: hsu: remove platform data
    
    There are no platforms where it's not possible to calculate
    the number of channels based on IO space length, and since
    that is the only purpose for struct hsu_dma_platform_data,
    removing it.

    dmaengine: append hsu DMA driver
    
    The HSU DMA is developed to support High Speed UART controllers found in
    particular on Intel MID platforms such as Intel Medfield.
    
    The existing implementation is tighten to the drivers/tty/serial/mfd.c driver
    and has a lot of disadvantages. Besides that we would like to get rid of the
    old HS UART driver in regarding to extending the 8250 which supports generic
    DMAEngine API. That's why the current driver has been developed.
