commit eb3798463f71afc77abd25b2f62708be06f7173b
Author: Gregor Boirie <gregor.boirie@parrot.com>
Date:   Wed Apr 20 19:23:45 2016 +0200

    iio:imu:mpu6050: enhance mounting matrix support
    
    Add a new rotation matrix sysfs attribute compliant with IIO core
    mounting matrix API.
    Matrix is retrieved from "in_anglvel_mount_matrix" and
    "in_accel_mount_matrix" sysfs attributes. It is declared into mpu6050 DTS
    entry as a "mount-matrix" property.
    
    Old interface is kept for backward userspace compatibility and may be
    retrieved from legacy platform_data mechanism only.
