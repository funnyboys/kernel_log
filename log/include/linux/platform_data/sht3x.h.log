    hwmon: add support for Sensirion SHT3x sensors
    
    This driver implements support for the Sensirion SHT3x-DIS chip,
    a humidity and temperature sensor. Temperature is measured
    in degrees celsius, relative humidity is expressed as a percentage.
    In the sysfs interface, all values are scaled by 1000,
    i.e. the value for 31.5 degrees celsius is 31500.
