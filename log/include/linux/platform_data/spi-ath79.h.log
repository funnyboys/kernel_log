commit b172fd0c898022c47161a99cb40be5304b0d3fd0
Author: Alban Bedel <albeu@free.fr>

    spi: ath79: Enable support for compile test
    
    To allow building this driver in compile test we need to remove all
    dependency on headers from arch/mips/include. To allow this we
    explicitly define all the registers locally instead of using
    ar71xx_regs.h and we move the platform data struct definition to
    include/linux/platform_data/spi-ath79.h.
