commit 4bcfda09936da647b0a3b49d5dcb3c6c6ebb0395
Author: Tan, Raymond <raymond.tan@intel.com>
Date:   Wed Sep 3 10:41:38 2014 +0800

    i2c: designware: add support of platform data to set I2C mode
    
    Use the platform data to set the clk_freq when there is no DT configuration
    available. The clk_freq in turn will determine the I2C speed mode.
    
    In Quark, there is currently no other configuration mechanism other than
    board files.
