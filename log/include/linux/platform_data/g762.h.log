commit 594fbe713bf60073ed884dc317a74dd5b327aba7
Author: Arnaud Ebalard <arno@natisbad.org>
Date:   Thu Jun 20 22:21:04 2013 +0200

    Add support for GMT G762/G763 PWM fan controllers
    
    GMT G762/763 fan speed PWM controller is connected directly to a fan
    and performs closed-loop or open-loop control of the fan speed. Two
    modes - PWM or DC - are supported by the chip. Introduced driver
    provides various knobs to control the operations of the chip (via
    sysfs interface). Specific characteristics of the system can be passed
    either using board init code or via DT. Documentation for both the
    driver and DT bindings are also provided.
