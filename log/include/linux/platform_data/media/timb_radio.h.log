commit eb4b0ec75ec34e90bd1594c665f16de0cb4e3bf9
Author: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@osg.samsung.com>

    [media] include/media: move platform_data to linux/platform_data/media
    
    Let's not mix platform_data headers with the core headers. Instead, let's
    create a subdir at linux/platform_data and move the headers to that
    common place, adding it to MAINTAINERS.
    
    The headers were moved with:
            mkdir include/linux/platform_data/media/; git mv include/media/gpio-ir-recv.h include/media/ir-rx51.h include/media/mmp-camera.h include/media/omap1_camera.h include/media/omap4iss.h include/media/s5p_hdmi.h include/media/si4713.h include/media/sii9234.h include/media/smiapp.h include/media/soc_camera.h include/media/soc_camera_platform.h include/media/timb_radio.h include/media/timb_video.h include/linux/platform_data/media/
    
    And the references fixed with this script:
        MAIN_DIR="linux/platform_data/"
        PREV_DIR="media/"
        DIRS="media/"
    
        echo "Checking affected files" >&2
        for i in $DIRS; do
            for j in $(find include/$MAIN_DIR/$i -type f -name '*.h'); do
                     n=`basename $j`
                    git grep -l $n
            done
        done|sort|uniq >files && (
            echo "Handling files..." >&2;
            echo "for i in \$(cat files|grep -v Documentation); do cat \$i | \\";
            (
                    cd include/$MAIN_DIR;
                    for j in $DIRS; do
                            for i in $(ls $j); do
                                    echo "perl -ne 's,(include [\\\"\\<])$PREV_DIR($i)([\\\"\\>]),\1$MAIN_DIR$j\2\3,; print \$_' |\\";
                            done;
                    done;
                    echo "cat > a && mv a \$i; done";
            );
            echo "Handling documentation..." >&2;
            echo "for i in MAINTAINERS \$(cat files); do cat \$i | \\";
            (
                    cd include/$MAIN_DIR;
                    for j in $DIRS; do
                            for i in $(ls $j); do
                                    echo "  perl -ne 's,include/$PREV_DIR($i)\b,include/$MAIN_DIR$j\1,; print \$_' |\\";
                            done;
                    done;
