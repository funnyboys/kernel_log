commit 283e4a82999f48c61495436b9bbd0357a3268f9d
Author: Robert Jarzmik <robert.jarzmik@free.fr>
Date:   Tue Sep 6 06:04:20 2016 -0300

    [media] media: platform: pxa_camera: make a standalone v4l2 device
    
    This patch removes the soc_camera API dependency from pxa_camera.
    In the current status :
     - all previously captures are working the same on pxa270
     - the s_crop() call was removed, judged not working
       (see what happens soc_camera_s_crop() when get_crop() == NULL)
     - if the pixel clock is provided by then sensor, ie. not MCLK, the dual
       stage change is not handled yet.
       => there is no in-tree user of this, so I'll let it that way
    
     - the MCLK is not yet finished, it's as in the legacy way,
       ie. activated at video device opening and closed at video device
       closing.
       In a subsequence patch pxa_camera_mclk_ops should be used, and
       platform data MCLK ignored. It will be the sensor's duty to request
       the clock and enable it, which will end in pxa_camera_mclk_ops.

    [media] move media platform data to linux/platform_data/media
    
    Now that media has its own subdirectory inside platform_data,
    let's move the headers that are already there to such subdir.
    
    After moving those files, the references were adjusted using this
    script:
    
        MAIN_DIR="linux/platform_data/"
        PREV_DIR="linux/platform_data/"
        DIRS="media/"
    
        echo "Checking affected files" >&2
        for i in $DIRS; do
            for j in $(find include/$MAIN_DIR/$i -type f -name '*.h'); do
                     n=`basename $j`
                    git grep -l $n
            done
        done|sort|uniq >files && (
            echo "Handling files..." >&2;
            echo "for i in \$(cat files|grep -v Documentation); do cat \$i | \\";
            (
                    cd include/$MAIN_DIR;
                    for j in $DIRS; do
                            for i in $(ls $j); do
                                    echo "perl -ne 's,(include [\\\"\\<])$PREV_DIR($i)([\\\"\\>]),\1$MAIN_DIR$j\2\3,; print \$_' |\\";
                            done;
                    done;
                    echo "cat > a && mv a \$i; done";
