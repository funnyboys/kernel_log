commit a71daaa10ec2e325f34d172b2782f2d68209b08d

    [media] move media platform data to linux/platform_data/media
    
    Now that media has its own subdirectory inside platform_data,
    let's move the headers that are already there to such subdir.
    
    After moving those files, the references were adjusted using this
    script:
    
        MAIN_DIR="linux/platform_data/"
        PREV_DIR="linux/platform_data/"
        DIRS="media/"
    
        echo "Checking affected files" >&2
        for i in $DIRS; do
            for j in $(find include/$MAIN_DIR/$i -type f -name '*.h'); do
                     n=`basename $j`
                    git grep -l $n
            done
        done|sort|uniq >files && (
            echo "Handling files..." >&2;
            echo "for i in \$(cat files|grep -v Documentation); do cat \$i | \\";
            (
                    cd include/$MAIN_DIR;
                    for j in $DIRS; do
                            for i in $(ls $j); do
                                    echo "perl -ne 's,(include [\\\"\\<])$PREV_DIR($i)([\\\"\\>]),\1$MAIN_DIR$j\2\3,; print \$_' |\\";
                            done;
                    done;
                    echo "cat > a && mv a \$i; done";
            );
            echo "Handling documentation..." >&2;
            echo "for i in MAINTAINERS \$(cat files); do cat \$i | \\";
            (
                    cd include/$MAIN_DIR;
                    for j in $DIRS; do

                            done;
                    done;
                    echo "cat > a && mv a \$i; done"
            );
        ) >script && . ./script
