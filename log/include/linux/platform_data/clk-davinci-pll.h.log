    clk: davinci: New driver for davinci PLL clocks
    
    This adds a new driver for mach-davinci PLL clocks. This is porting the
    code from arch/arm/mach-davinci/clock.c to the common clock framework.
    Additionally, it adds device tree support for these clocks.
    
    The ifeq ($(CONFIG_COMMON_CLK), y) in the Makefile is needed to prevent
    compile errors until the clock code in arch/arm/mach-davinci is removed.
    
    Note: although there are similar clocks for TI Keystone we are not able
    to share the code for a few reasons. The keystone clocks are device tree
    only and use legacy one-node-per-clock bindings. Also the register
    layouts are a bit different, which would add even more if/else mess
    to the keystone clocks. And the keystone PLL driver doesn't support
    setting clock rates.
