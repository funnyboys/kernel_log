    ASoC: omap-twl4030: Update the header file to support more boards
    
    The common machine driver will be able to support new boards where the voice
    port is also in use.
    At the same time add possibility to fine tune the connections from twl4030
    on the board: jack detection GPIO, input/output selection

commit fff8491c8b8cce5fc9190e025d1a665f2ee71a4f
Author: Peter Ujfalusi <peter.ujfalusi@ti.com>
Date:   Tue Aug 14 12:07:56 2012 +0300

    ASoC: omap-twl4030: Simple machine driver for TI SoC with twl4030 codec
    
    Machine driver to handle simple devices using twl4030 as audio codec.
    The driver supports the following boards:
    - Beagleboard or Devkit8000
    - Gumstix Overo or CompuLab CM-T35/CM-T3730
    - IGEP v2
    - OMAP3EVM
    
    All of these boards can be switched to use this driver since their setup is
    identical.
    Devicetree support for the omap-twl4030 machine driver also implemented.
