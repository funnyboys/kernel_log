    leds: bd2802: Convert to use GPIO descriptors
    
    The Rohm BD2802 have no in-kernel users so we can drop the
    GPIO number from the platform data and require users to
    provide the GPIO line using machine descriptors.
    
    As the descriptors come with inherent polarity inversion
    semantics, we invert the calls to set the GPIO line such
    that 0 means "unasserted" and 1 means "asserted".
    
    Put a note in the driver that machine descriptor tables
    will need to specify that the line is active low.

    leds: add BD2802GU LED driver
    
    ROHM BD2802GU is a RGB LED controller attached to i2c bus and specifically
    engineered for decoration purposes.  This RGB controller incorporates
    lighting patterns and illuminates.
    
    This driver is designed to minimize power consumption, so when there is no
    emitting LED, it enters to reset state.  And because the BD2802GU has lots
    of features that can't be covered by the current LED framework, it
    provides Advanced Configuration Function(ADF) mode, so that user
    applications can set registers of BD2802GU directly.
    
    Here are basic usage examples :
    ; to turn on LED (not blink)
    $ echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/led1_R/brightness
    ; to blink LED
    $ echo timer > /sys/class/leds/led1_R/trigger
    $ echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/led1_R/delay_on
    $ echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/led1_R/delay_off
    ; to turn off LED
    $ echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/led1_R/brightness
