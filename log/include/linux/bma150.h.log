commit 0db3863add5cb249520b31a4ad36f275a30e7ba6
Author: Michael Trimarchi <michael@amarulasolutions.com>
Date:   Fri Feb 15 14:43:38 2013 -0800

    Input: bma150 - make some defines public and fix some comments
    
    Make the constants referring to range and bandwidth public so they can
    be used when initializing the platform data fields in the platform code.
    
    Fix also some comments regarding the unit of measurement to use for the
    range and bandwidth fields, the values are not actually expected to be
    in G or HZ, the code in bma150.c just uses the BMA150_RANGE_xxx and
    BMA150_BW_xxx constants like they are with no translation from actual
    values in G or HZ.
