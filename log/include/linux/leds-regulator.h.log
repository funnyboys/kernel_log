    include/linux/leds-regulator.h: fix syntax in example code
    
    Fix struct field initializer syntax in some example code from a comment,
    this will make copying and pasting the code more straightforward.

    leds: Add LED class driver for regulator driven LEDs.
    
    This driver provides an interface for controlling LEDs (or vibrators)
    connected to PMICs for which there is a regulator framework driver.
    
    This driver can be used, for instance, to control vibrator on all Motorola EZX
    phones using the pcap-regulator driver services.
