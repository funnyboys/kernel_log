commit a62c80e559809e6c7851ec04d30575e85ad6f6ed
Author: Russell King <rmk@dyn-67.arm.linux.org.uk>
Date:   Sat Jan 7 13:52:45 2006 +0000

    [ARM] Move AMBA include files to include/linux/amba/
    
    Since the ARM AMBA bus is used on MIPS as well as ARM, we need
    to make the bus available for other architectures to use.  Move
    the AMBA include files from include/asm-arm/hardware/ to
    include/linux/amba/
