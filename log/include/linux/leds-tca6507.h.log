    leds: add driver for TCA6507 LED controller
    
    TI's TCA6507 is the LED driver in the GTA04 Openmoko motherboard.  The
    driver provides full support for brightness levels and hardware blinking.
    
    This driver can drive each of 7 outputs as an LED or a GPIO output,
    and provides hardware-assist blinking.
