    cc2520: fix CC2591 handling
    
    This patch changes tha way of handling of cc2591-cc2520 combination
    by moving amplified variable from platform data to private data.
    This will be useful in other sections like tx power support.

    cc2520: Add support for CC2591 amplifier.
    
    The TI CC2521 is an RF power amplifier that is designed to interface
    with the CC2520. Conveniently, it directly interfaces with the CC2520
    and does not require any pins to be connected to a
    microcontroller/processor. Adding a CC2591 increases the CC2520's range,
    which is useful for border router and other wall-powered applications.
    
    Using the CC2591 with the CC2520 requires configuring the CC2520 GPIOs
    that are connected to the CC2591 to correctly set the CC2591 into TX and
    RX modes. Further, TI recommends that the CC2520_TXPOWER and
    CC2520_AGCCTRL1 registers are set differently to maximize the CC2591's
    performance. These settings are covered in TI Application Note AN065.
    
    This patch adds an optional `amplified` field to the cc2520 entry in the
    device tree. If present, the CC2520 will be configured to operate with a
    CC2591.
    
    The expected pin mapping is:
    CC2520 GPIO0 --> CC2591 EN
    CC2520 GPIO5 --> CC2591 PAEN

    ieee802154: cc2520: adds driver for TI CC2520 radio
    
    This patch adds the driver support for the cc2520 radio.
    
    Driver support:
            - Tx and Rx of IEEE-802.15.4 packets
            - Energy Detection on channel
            - Setting the Channel for the radio. [b/w 11 - 26 channels]
            - Start and Stop the radio
            - h/w address filtering
