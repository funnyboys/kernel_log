    backlight: spi driver for LMS283GF05 LCD
    
    ADd support for the SPI part of LMS283GF05 LCD.  The LCD uses SPI for
    initialization and powerdown sequences.  No further defails are specified
    in the datasheet about the initialization/powerdown sequence, just the
    magic numbers that have to be sent over SPI bus.  This LCD can be found in
    the Aeronix Zipit Z2 handheld.
