    spi: sh-hspi: control spi clock more correctly
    
    Current sh-hspi had used platform-specific speed.
    This patch remove it, and use spi_transfer specific speed.
    It removes unnecessary flags from struct sh_hspi_info,
    but struct sh_hspi_info is still exist, since sh-hspi needs
    platform info in the future.

    spi: Add SuperH HSPI prototype driver
    
    This patch adds SuperH HSPI driver.
    It is still prototype driver, but has enough function at this point.
