    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    Input: ads7846 - add support for AD7843 parts
    
    The AD7873 is almost identical to the ADS7846; the only difference is
    related to the Power Management bits PD0 and PD1.  This results in a
    slightly different PENIRQ enable behavior.  For the AD7873, VREF should
    be turned off during differential measurements.
    
    So, add the AD7873/43 to the list of driver supported devices, and prevent
    VREF usage during differential/ratiometric conversion modes.

    Input: ads7846 - introduce sample settling delay
    
    The ads7846 driver has support for filtering, but when the chip gets
    deselected between samples this causes noise. This patch adds support
    for an optional settling delay time, so that two consecutive samples
    will be taken with the specified delay time apart.  This ensures that
    the chip won't be deselected, so the noise won't appear.
    
    Filtering can still be done, but will have less work to do since each
    time a new sample is taken the same delay applies.

    Input: ads7846 - improve filtering for thumb press accuracy
    
    Providing more accurate coordinates for thumb press requires additional
    steps in the filtering logic:
    
    - Ignore samples found invalid by the debouncing logic, or the ones that
      have out of bound pressure value.
    - Add a parameter to repeat debouncing, so that more then two consecutive
      good readings are required for a valid sample.

    Input: ads7846 - handle IRQs that were latched during disabled IRQs
    
    The pen down IRQ will toggle during each X,Y,Z measurement cycle.
    Even though the IRQ is disabled it will be latched and delivered
    when after enable_irq. Thus in the IRQ handler we must avoid
    starting a new measurement cycle when such an "unwanted" IRQ happens.
    Add a get_pendown_state platform function, which will probably
    determine this by reading the current GPIO level of the pen IRQ pin.
    
    Move the IRQ reenabling from the SPI RX function to the timer. After
    the last power down message the pen IRQ pin is still active for a
    while and get_pendown_state would report incorrectly a pen down state.
    
    When suspending we should check the ts->pending flag instead of
    ts->pendown, since the timer can be pending regardless of ts->pendown.
    Also if ts->pending is set we can be sure that the timer is running,
    so no need to rearm it. Similarly if ts->pending is not set we can
    be sure that the IRQ is enabled (and the timer is not).

    [PATCH] spi: ads7846 driver
    
    This is a driver for the ADS7846 touchscreen sensor, derived from
    the corgi_ts and omap_ts drivers.  Key differences from those two:
    
      - Uses the new SPI framework (minimalist version)
      - <linux/spi/ads7846.h> abstracts board-specific touchscreen info
      - Sysfs attributes for the temperature and voltage sensors
      - Uses fewer ARM-specific IRQ primitives
    
    The temperature and voltage sensors show up in sysfs like this:
    
      $ pwd
      /sys/devices/platform/omap-uwire/spi2.0
      $ ls
      bus@          input:event0@ power/        temp1         vbatt
      driver@       modalias      temp0         vaux
      $ cat modalias
      ads7846
      $ cat temp0
      991
      $ cat temp1
      1177
      $
    
    So far only basic testing has been done.  There's a fair amount of hardware
    that uses this sensor, and which also runs Linux, which should eventually
    be able to use this driver.
    
    One portability note may be of special interest.  It turns out that not all
    SPI controllers are happy issuing requests that do things like "write 8 bit
    command, read 12 bit response".  Most of them seem happy to handle various
    word sizes, so the issue isn't "12 bit response" but rather "different rx
    and tx write sizes", despite that being a common MicroWire convention.  So
    this version of the driver no longer reads 12 bit native-endian words; it
    reads 16-bit big-endian responses, then byteswaps them and shifts the
    results to discard the noise.
