commit 447aef1a19135a69bfd725c33f7e753740cb8447
Author: Ben Dooks <ben@trinity.fluff.org>
Date:   Tue Jul 17 04:04:10 2007 -0700

    SPI: tle620x power switch driver
    
    Add support for the Infineon TLE62x0 series of low-side driver chips, such
    as the TLE6220 or TLE6230.  These can be viewed as output GPIOs specialized
    for power switching applications.  The driver provides a userspace
    interface to those GPIOs, and to the switch status they provide.
