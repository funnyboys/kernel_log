commit 9c5de2c1754c2bb3c69c4d7bf0d0edc0a61d8232
Author: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert+renesas@glider.be>
Date:   Mon Jun 2 15:38:05 2014 +0200

    spi: rspi: Remove unused 16-bit DMA support
    
    The 16-bit DMA support doesn't fit well within the SPI core DMA framework,
    as it needs to manage its own double-sized temporary buffers, for handling
    the interleaved data.
    Remove it, as there is no in-tree board code that sets
    rspi_plat_data.dma_width_16bit.

    spi/rspi: add dmaengine support
    
    This patch adds dmaengine supporting using sh_dma driver. The module
    receives data by DMAC, it also needs TX DMAC to generate SPI's clocks.
