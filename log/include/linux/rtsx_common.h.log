commit e455b69ddf9b69326d0cab28d374faf3325489c9
Author: Rui Feng <rui_feng@realsil.com.cn>
Date:   Wed Nov 29 17:08:03 2017 +0800

    misc: rtsx: Move Realtek Card Reader Driver to misc
    
    Because Realtek card reader drivers are pcie and usb drivers,
    and they bridge mmc subsystem and memstick subsystem, they are
    not mfd drivers. Greg and Lee Jones had a discussion about
    where to put the drivers, the result is that misc is a good
    place for them, so I move all files to misc. If I don't move
    them to a right place, I can't add any patch for this driver.
