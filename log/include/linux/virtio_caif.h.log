    caif_virtio: Introduce caif over virtio
    
    Add the CAIF Virtio shared memory driver for talking
    to a modem.
    
    This CAIF Link layer communicates to the modem over
    shared memory. It is implemented as a virtio_driver.
    The underlying virtio device is managed by the remoteproc
    framework. The Virtio queue is used for transmitting data
    to the modem, and the new vringh is used for receiving data.
    
    Genalloc is used for managing the shared memory used for TX
    data. The default dma-alloc-coherent allocator can only
    allocate whole pages, and this wastes too much shared memory.
    
    Flow control is implemented by stopping the TX-queues if the
    virtio queues go full or we run out of memory. Queued are
    reopened when queues are below the watermark.
    
    NAPI is used in RX path, and a dedicated tasklet is used
    for releasing TX buffers.
