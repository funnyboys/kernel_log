    UAPI: ndctl: Remove use of PAGE_SIZE
    
    The macro PAGE_SIZE isn't valid outside of the kernel, so it should not
    appear in UAPI headers.
    
    Furthermore, the actual machine page size could theoretically change from
    an application's point of view if it's running in a container that gets
    migrated to another machine (say 4K/ppc64 to 64K/ppc64).
    
    Fixes: f2ba5a5baecf ("libnvdimm, namespace: make min namespace size 4K")
