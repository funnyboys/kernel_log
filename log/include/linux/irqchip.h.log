    irqchip / ACPI: Add probing infrastructure for ACPI-based irqchips
    
    DT enjoys a rather nice probing infrastructure for irqchips, while
    ACPI is so far stuck into a very distant past.
    
    This patch introduces a declarative API, allowing irqchips to be
    self-contained and be called when a particular entry is matched
    in the MADT table.

    irqchip: Move IRQCHIP_DECLARE macro to include/linux/irqchip.h
    
    At the moment the IRQCHIP_DECLARE macro is only declared locally in
    drivers/irqchip/irqchip.h. It prevents from using it directly in arch/*
    directories whenever irqchip drivers only exist there, which happens in a few
    cases (e.g. arc, arm, microblaze and mips).
    
    This patch makes the macro to be globally defined, i.e. in
    include/linux/irqchip.h, and thus usable for arch-specific declarations of
    irqchip drivers. In this way, it is very similar to what clocksource does (ie
    CLOCKSOURCE_OF_DECLARE is defined in include/linux/clocksource.h).
    
    For now, this patch only moves the declaration of the macro
    IRQCHIP_DECLARE to the global header 'include/linux/irqchip.h' and make
    'drivers/irqchip/irqchip.h' include 'include/linux/irqchip.h'. Later, other
    patches will get rid of 'drivers/irqchip/irqchip.h' and modify all the impacted
    irqchip drivers.

    irqchip: Add irqchip_init dummy function
    
    We add an empty irqchip_init dummy function for cases in which
    CONFIG_IRQCHIP is not used. In these cases irqchip.c is not compiled,
    but a funtion call may still be present in architecture code, that in
    runtime doesn't get hit.
    
    E.g. this is needed in the arch/arm/mach-shmobile/intc-r8a7740.c
    interrupt setup code where OF use and non OF us is both handled in one
    file.

commit f6e916b82022cba67bdd0ec7df84e2bce2ef3f73

    irqchip: add basic infrastructure
    
    With the recent creation of the drivers/irqchip/ directory, it is
    desirable to move irq controller drivers here. At the moment, the only
    driver here is irq-bcm2835, the driver for the irq controller found in
    the ARM BCM2835 SoC, present in Rasberry Pi systems. This irq
    controller driver was exporting its initialization function and its
    irq handling function through a header file in
    <linux/irqchip/bcm2835.h>.
    
    When proposing to also move another irq controller driver in
    drivers/irqchip, Rob Herring raised the very valid point that moving
    things to drivers/irqchip was good in order to remove more stuff from
    arch/arm, but if it means adding gazillions of headers files in
    include/linux/irqchip/, it would not be very nice.
    
    So, upon the suggestion of Rob Herring and Arnd Bergmann, this commit
    introduces a small infrastructure that defines a central
    irqchip_init() function in drivers/irqchip/irqchip.c, which is meant
    to be called as the ->init_irq() callback of ARM platforms. This
    function calls of_irq_init() with an array of match strings and init
    functions generated from a special linker section.
    
    Note that the irq controller driver initialization function is
    responsible for setting the global handle_arch_irq() variable, so that
    ARM platforms no longer have to define the ->handle_irq field in their
    DT_MACHINE structure.
    
    A global header, <linux/irqchip.h> is also added to expose the single
    irqchip_init() function to the reset of the kernel.
    
    A further commit moves the BCM2835 irq controller driver to this new
    small infrastructure, therefore removing the include/linux/irqchip/
    directory.
