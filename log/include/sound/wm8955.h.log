    ASoC: Add initial WM8955 CODEC driver
    
    The WM8955 is a low power, high quality stereo DAC with integrated
    headphone and loudspeaker amplifiers, designed to reduce external
    component requirements in portable digital audio applications. This is
    an initial driver implementing support for the majority of the
    functionality in the device, currently OUT3 is not supported.
