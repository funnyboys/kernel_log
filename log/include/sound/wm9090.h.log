commit 39b8eab7e7fe429d8d57f18c0ebdb7c25df55f5c
Author: Mark Brown <broonie@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>
Date:   Wed Apr 28 18:36:10 2010 +0100

    ASoC: Add WM9090 amplifier driver
    
    The WM9090 is a high performance low power audio subsystem, including
    headphone and class D speaker drivers.
    
    Note that this driver is a standalone CODEC driver and so is only
    immediately suitable for use with the WM9090 as a standalone sound card
    taking line inputs, or with a DAC with no software control.  The pending
    ASoC multi-CODEC support will expand the range of systems that can use
    the driver, or system-specific adaptations can be made.
