commit a6e4599f8d232b5911c46bb16f5a79b86f3dfb75
Author: Lars-Peter Clausen <lars@metafoo.de>

    ASoC: uda134x: Remove is_powered_on_standby from platform data
    
    According to its documentation the is_powered_on_standby field of the
    uda134x platform data is supposed to prevent the the driver from shutting
    down the ADC and DAC in standby mode. This behavior was broken in commit
    commit f0fba2ad1b6b ("ASoC: multi-component - ASoC Multi-Component Support")
    almost 5 years ago and all the flag does now is cause the driver to go to
    SND_SOC_BIAS_ON in probe, just for the ASoC core to put it back into
    SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY right after probe.
    
    Apparently the intended behavior has not been missed, so just remove
    is_powered_on_standby from the platform data struct.

    ASoC: uda134x: replace a macro with a value in platform struct.
    
    This change wipes out a hardcoded macro, which enables codec bias
    level control. Now is_powered_on_standby value shall be used instead.
