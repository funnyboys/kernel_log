    ASoC: wm8960: remove 'dres' field from platform data structure
    
    The 'dres' field (discharge resistance for headphone outputs) is no longer
    used in the driver, so remove it.
    
    It was used in the original version of the driver when entering standby
    from off, but we stopped using it when we switched from having a single
    startup sequence to having separate cap and capless sequences.

    ASoC: wm8960: Support shared LRCLK
    
    If the LRCLK is shared and the WM8960 is clock master then we should
    enable the LRCM bit to tell the device that it should drive LRCLK when
    either ADC or DAC is enabled rather than separately driving the two
    LRCLKs.

commit 913d7b4cc0d958df9f2e4bc0e6926c037d96d07e
Author: Mark Brown <broonie@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>
Date:   Wed Mar 3 13:47:03 2010 +0000

    ASoC: Add support for WM8960 capless mode
    
    The WM8960 headphone outputs can be run in capless mode with OUT3
    used to drive a pseudo ground for the headphone drivers. In this
    mode the mono mixer is not used, the mixer should be turned on
    in concert with the headphone output drivers and the device bias
    levels are managed differently.
    
    Also tweak the existing bias management to remove the use of active
    discharge while we're at it since that's often audible.
