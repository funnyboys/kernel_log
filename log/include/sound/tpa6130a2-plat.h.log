commit 0722d055ac2236da4e319d22a99c9f7e82dbdd5d
Author: Peter Ujfalusi <peter.ujfalusi@ti.com>
Date:   Tue Aug 30 14:39:54 2011 +0300

    ASoC: tpa6130a2: Remove model_id from platform data
    
    The model_id is no longer needed within the platform_data
    for the TPA driver since the model of TPA specified
    with the device name (tpa6130a2/tpa6140a2).
    
    Also update rx51 (the only affected user) to use the device name rather
    than platform data.

commit 493b67efffc462703d583389aca96f850c18d3b3
Author: Peter Ujfalusi <peter.ujfalusi@nokia.com>
Date:   Fri Oct 9 15:55:41 2009 +0300

    ASoC: TPA6130A2 amplifier driver
    
    Driver for Texas Instruments TPA6130A2 stereo headphone
    amplifier.
    
    The driver provides playback gain control and also pre-defined
    DAPM_HP widgets and DAPM routings for power management.
    
    The DAPM_HP widget names are:
    "TPA6130A2 Headphone Left"
    "TPA6130A2 Headphone Right"
    
    From soc machine drivers to use with the tpa6130a2 amplifier,
    the tpa6130a2_add_controls has to be called, which adds the alsa
    controls and the DAPM routing needed for the tpa6130a2.
    After that the machine driver can connect the codec's output
    with 'TPA6130A2 Left' and 'TPA6130A2 Right':
    
            {"TPA6130A2 Left", NULL, "CODEC LEFT OUT"},
            {"TPA6130A2 Right", NULL, "CODEC RIGHT OUT"},
    
    Internally the left and right channels are powered separately.
    When none of the channels are needed the amplifier is powered
    down:
    hard power: valid GPIO number is passed within platform data
    soft power: Using the software shutdown of the amplifier
