commit 1abd91849990ed61d6468ffa8b7fc1ae61db4b1a

    ASoC: UDA1380: refactor device registration
    
    This patch mostly follows commit 5998102b9095fdb7c67755812038612afea315c5
    "ASoC: Refactor WM8731 device registration" to make UDA1380 use standard
    device instantiation. Similarly, the I2C device registration temporarily
    moves into the magician machine driver before it will find its final
    resting place in the board file.
    
    At the same time, platform specific configuration is moved to platform data
    and common power/reset GPIO handling moves into the codec driver.
