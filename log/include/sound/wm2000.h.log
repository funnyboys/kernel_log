commit d61100bbd18e8b3fc9406be55354dabd5e7525ec
Author: Mark Brown <broonie@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>

    ASoC: wm2000: Use clock API integration to configure MCLK divisor
    
    Since we are now using the clock API integration to manage MCLK we can now
    use clk_get_rate() to determine if we need to divide MCLK without relying
    on platform data.

    ASoC: Add WM2000 driver
    
    The WM2000 is a low power, high quality handset receiver speaker
    driver with Wolfson myZoneâ„¢ Ambient Noise Cancellation (ANC). It
    provides enhanced voice communication quality in a noisy environment
    if the handset acoustics are designed appropriately.
