    ASoC: SPEAr: remove custom DMA alloc compat function
    
    spear_pcm_request_chan() is almost identical to
    dmaengine_pcm_compat_request_channel(), with the exception that the
    latter:
    
    a) Assumes that the DAI DMA data is a struct snd_dmaengine_dai_dma_data
       pointer rather than some custom type.
    
    b) dma_data->filter_data rather than dma_data should be passed to
       snd_dmaengine_pcm_request_channel() as the filter data.
    
    Make minor changes to the SPEAr DAI drivers so that those two conditions
    are met. This allows removal of the custom .compat_request_channel().
