commit 213eb0fb1e8e4ddfb8ffdb239c45ba2a1eef3dc2
Author: Mark Brown <broonie@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>
Date:   Wed Sep 21 20:54:47 2011 +0100

    ASoC: Add platform data for WM1250 EV1 GPIOs
    
    The WM1250 EV1 has some GPIOs which can be used to control the behaviour
    at runtime. Request them all if supplied and add a set_bias_level()
    function to start and stop the clocks.
