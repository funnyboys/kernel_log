    drm: omapdrm: hdmi: Pass HDMI core version as integer to HDMI audio
    
    The HDMI audio driver only needs to know which generation of HDMI
    transmitter it deals with, not the detailed SoC model. Pass the version
    number as an integer to prepare for removal of the OMAP SoC version from
    the omapdrm driver.

    omapdss: hdmi audio: Make header file independent of video/omapdss.h
    
    Clean up the header files regarding to hdmi audio so the omap-hdmi-audio.h
    file will only need to include the platform_data/omapdss.h file.

    ASoC: omap-hdmi-audio: Add platform device for OMAP HDMI audio support
    
    The platform device should only be registered from OMAPDSS HDMI
    driver. The platform driver registers and unregisters all ASoC
    components needed for OMAP HDMI audio.
    
    The hdmi audio driver implements cpu-dai component using the callbacks
    provided by OMAPDSS and registers the component under DSS HDMI
    device. Omap-pcm is registered for platform component also under DSS
    HDMI device. Dummy codec is used as as codec component. The hdmi audio
    driver implements also the card and registers it under its own
    platform device.
