commit e3523e01869da20fdd12ffd19ae1df7bf492650e
Author: Dimitris Papastamos <dp@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>

    ASoC: wm0010: Add initial wm0010 DSP driver
    
    The WM0010 is a compact digital signal processor that has been
    highly optimised for low-power audio applications.  Extensive memory
    resources and core optimisation allow the device to manage all audio
    processing algorithms efficiently and autonomously, while the host
    processor sleeps or performs other tasks.
