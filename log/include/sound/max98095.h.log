    ASoC: max98095: add jack detection
    
    This change adds the logic to support using the jack detect mechanism built
    in to the codec to detect both when a jack was inserted and what type of
    jack is present.
    
    This change also supports the use of an external mechanism for headphone
    detection. If this mechanism exists, when the max98095_jack_detect function
    is called, the hp_jack is simply passed NULL.
    
    This change supports both simple headphones, powered headphones, microphones
    and headsets with both headphones and a mic.
