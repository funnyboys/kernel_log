commit 9dcaa7b25f2c8f6a0485854cd3641f585a154072
Author: Rafael Ignacio Zurita <rizurita@yahoo.com>
Date:   Tue Nov 3 17:16:27 2009 -0300

    ALSA: sh: add SuperH DAC audio driver for ALSA V4
    
    This is a port of the sound/oss/sh_dac_audio.c driver.
    The driver uses an on-chip 8-bit D/A converter, which has a speaker connected
    to one of its channels, found in several ancient HP machines.
    For interrupts it uses a high-resolution timer (hrtimer).
    Tested on SH7709 based hp6xx (HP Jornada 680/690 and HP Palmtop 620lx/660lx).
    
    Also, since OSS Emulation works, the old OSS sound/oss/sh_dac_audio.c driver
    would be obsolete soon, and it could be removed.
