commit 6d4baf084f4d8dc43cf5d5a3c182018604afa80c
Author: Mark Brown <broonie@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 20 15:44:21 2011 +0100

    ASoC: Add WM5100 driver
    
    The WM5100 is a highly integrated low power audio subsystem with advanced
    digital signal processing capabilities including effects, speech clarity
    enhancement and active noise cancellation.  This initial driver provides
    support for basic audio paths, further patches will provide more
    complete functionality.
