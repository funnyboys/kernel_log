    xen/privcmd: Add IOCTL_PRIVCMD_DM_OP
    
    Recently a new dm_op[1] hypercall was added to Xen to provide a mechanism
    for restricting device emulators (such as QEMU) to a limited set of
    hypervisor operations, and being able to audit those operations in the
    kernel of the domain in which they run.
    
    This patch adds IOCTL_PRIVCMD_DM_OP as gateway for __HYPERVISOR_dm_op.
    
    NOTE: There is no requirement for user-space code to bounce data through
          locked memory buffers (as with IOCTL_PRIVCMD_HYPERCALL) since
          privcmd has enough information to lock the original buffers
          directly.
