commit a2686766c81e18fb1ab9375cf5d3cbd54a3bed2c
Author: Thierry Reding <treding@nvidia.com>

    soc/tegra: Implement runtime check for Tegra SoCs
    
    Subsequent patches will move some of the initialization code from SoC
    setup code to regular initcalls. To prevent breakage on other SoCs in
    multi-platform builds, these initcalls need to check that they indeed
    run on Tegra.
