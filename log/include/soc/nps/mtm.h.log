commit 09dcd1958be42ea473fef24a2c02d975f520ea71

    soc: Support for NPS HW scheduling
    
    This new header file is for NPS400 SoC (part of ARC architecture).
    The header file includes macros for save/restore of HW scheduling.
    The control of HW scheduling is achieved by writing core registers.
    This code was moved from arc/plat-eznps so it can be used
    from drivers/clocksource/, available only for CONFIG_EZNPS_MTM_EXT.
