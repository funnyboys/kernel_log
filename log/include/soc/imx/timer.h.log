commit 0931aff7226abb7e1dab018488e363294385fa66
Author: Shawn Guo <shawn.guo@linaro.org>
Date:   Fri May 15 11:41:39 2015 +0800

    ARM: imx: define an enum for gpt timer device type
    
    Define an enum for gpt timer device type in include/soc/imx/timer.h to
    tell the gpt block differences among SoCs.  Update non-DT users (clock
    drivers) to pass the device type.
    
    As we now have include/soc/imx/timer.h, the declaration of
    mxc_timer_init() is moved into there as the best fit.
