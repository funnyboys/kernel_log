    thermal: exynos: Rename Samsung and Exynos to lowercase
    
    Fix up inconsistent usage of upper and lowercase letters in "Samsung"
    and "Exynos" names.
    
    "SAMSUNG" and "EXYNOS" are not abbreviations but regular trademarked
    names.  Therefore they should be written with lowercase letters starting
    with capital letter.
    
    The lowercase "Exynos" name is promoted by its manufacturer Samsung
    Electronics Co., Ltd., in advertisement materials and on website.
    
    Although advertisement materials usually use uppercase "SAMSUNG", the
    lowercase version is used in all legal aspects (e.g. on Wikipedia and in
    privacy/legal statements on
    https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/privacy-global/).

commit f5576e3a9ea48334289aaaa711080d09e3405099

    thermal: exynos: Provide thermal_exynos.h file to be included in device tree files
    
    This patch is a preparatory patch to be able to read Exynos thermal
    configuration from the device tree.
    
    It turned out that DTC is not able to interpret enums properly and hence
    it is necessary to #define those values explicitly.
    
    For this reason the ./include/dt-bindings/thermal/thermal_exynos.h file
    has been introduced.
