    thermal: Fix cdev registration with THERMAL_NO_LIMIT on 64bit
    
    The size of unsigned long varies between 32 and 64 bit systems while
    the size of phandle arguments is always 32 bits per parameter.
    
    On 64-bit systems, cooling devices registered via of-thermal apis fail
    to bind when the min/max cooling state is specified as
    THERMAL_NO_LIMIT (-1UL) as there is a mis-match between the value read
    from the device tree (32bit) and the pre-processor define (64bit).
    
    As we're unlikely to need cooling states larger than 32 bits, and for
    consistency with the size of phandle arguments, explicitly limit
    THERMAL_NO_LIMIT to 32 bits.

    thermal: introduce device tree parser
    
    This patch introduces a device tree bindings for
    describing the hardware thermal behavior and limits.
    Also a parser to read and interpret the data and feed
    it in the thermal framework is presented.
    
    This patch introduces a thermal data parser for device
    tree. The parsed data is used to build thermal zones
    and thermal binding parameters. The output data
    can then be used to deploy thermal policies.
    
    This patch adds also documentation regarding this
    API and how to define tree nodes to use
    this infrastructure.
    
    Note that, in order to be able to have control
    on the sensor registration on the DT thermal zone,
    it was required to allow changing the thermal zone
    .get_temp callback. For this reason, this patch
    also removes the 'const' modifier from the .ops
    field of thermal zone devices.
