    media: partial revert of "[media] tvp5150: add HW input connectors support"
    
    Commit f7b4b54e6364 ("[media] tvp5150: add HW input connectors support")
    added input signals support for the tvp5150, but the approach was found
    to be incorrect so the corresponding DT binding commit 82c2ffeb217a
    ("[media] tvp5150: document input connectors DT bindings") was reverted.
    
    This left the driver with an undocumented (and wrong) DT parsing logic,
    so lets get rid of this code as well until the input connectors support
    is implemented properly.
    
    It's a partial revert due other patches added on top of mentioned commit
    not allowing the commit to be reverted cleanly anymore. But all the code
    related to the DT parsing logic and input entities creation are removed.

    [media] tvp5150: replace MEDIA_ENT_F_CONN_TEST by a control
    
    MEDIA_ENT_F_CONN_TEST is not really a connector, it is actually
    a signal generator. Also, as other drivers use the
    V4L2_CID_TEST_PATTERN control for signal generators, let's change
    the driver accordingly.
    
    Tested with Terratec Grabster AV350.

    [media] tvp5150: add HW input connectors support
    
    The tvp5150 decoder has different input connectors. The actual list of
    HW inputs depends on the device version but all have at least these 3:
    
    1) Composite0
    2) Composite1
    3) S-Video
    
    and some variants have a 4th possible input connector:
    
    4) Signal generator
    
    The driver currently uses the .s_routing callback to switch the input
    connector but since these are separate HW blocks, it's better to use
    media entities to represent the input connectors and their source pads
    linked with the decoder's sink pad.
    
    This allows user-space to use the MEDIA_IOC_SETUP_LINK ioctl to choose
    the input connector. For example using the media-ctl user-space tool:
    
    $ media-ctl -r -l '"Composite0":0->"tvp5150 1-005c":0[1]'
