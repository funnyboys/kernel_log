commit 7132fe4f568721cbd5d9bce5a8a71556e9bc45b4
Author: Dan Murphy <dmurphy@ti.com>

    Input: drv260x - add TI drv260x haptics driver
    
    Add the TI drv260x haptics/vibrator driver.  This device uses the input
    force feedback to produce a wave form to driver an ERM or LRA actuator
    device.
    
    The initial driver supports the devices real time playback mode.  But the
    device has additional wave patterns in ROM. This functionality will be
    added in future patchsets.
