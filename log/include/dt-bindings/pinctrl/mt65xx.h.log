    pinctrl: mediatek: Add Pinctrl/GPIO driver for mt8135.
    
    The mediatek SoCs have GPIO controller that handle both the muxing and GPIOs.
    
    The GPIO controller have pinmux, pull enable, pull select, direction and output high/low control.
    
    This driver include common driver and mt8135 part.
    The common driver include the pinctrl driver and GPIO driver.
    The mt8135 part contain its special device data.
