    include: dt-bindings: rockchip: remove unused defines
    
    The Rockchip dtsi and dts files have been bulk-converted for the
    remaining raw gpio numbers into their descriptive counterparts and
    also got rid of the unhelpful RK_FUNC_x -> x and RK_GPIOx -> x
    mappings, so remove the unused defines in 'rockchip.h' to prevent
    that someone start using them again.

    include: dt-bindings: rockchip: mark RK_FUNC defines as deprecated
    
    The defines RK_FUNC_1, RK_FUNC_2, RK_FUNC_3 and RK_FUNC_4
    are no longer used. Mark them as "deprecated"
    to prevent that someone start using them again.

    pinctrl: Add mux options 3 and 4 for rockchip pinctrl
    
    Newer Rockchip SoCs have more muxing slots.  Add slots 3 and 4 since
    the rk3288 table goes all the way up to 4.

commit d3e5116119bd02ea7716bbe04b39c21bba4bcf42
Author: Heiko St√ºbner <heiko@sntech.de>
Date:   Mon Jun 10 22:16:22 2013 +0200

    pinctrl: add pinctrl driver for Rockchip SoCs
    
    This driver adds support the Cortex-A9 based SoCs from Rockchip,
    so at least the RK2928, RK3066 (a and b) and RK3188.
    Earlier Rockchip SoCs seem to use similar mechanics for gpio
    handling so should be supportable with relative small changes.
    Pull handling on the rk3188 is currently a stub, due to it being
    a bit different to the earlier SoCs.
    
    Pinmuxing as well as gpio (and interrupt-) handling tested on
    a rk3066a based machine.
