    regulator: dt-bindings: add QCOM RPMh regulator bindings
    
    Introduce bindings for RPMh regulator devices found on some
    Qualcomm Technlogies, Inc. SoCs.  These devices allow a given
    processor within the SoC to make PMIC regulator requests which
    are aggregated within the RPMh hardware block along with requests
    from other processors in the SoC to determine the final PMIC
    regulator hardware state.

+ * These mode constants may be used to specify modes for various RPMh regulator
+ * device tree properties (e.g. regulator-initial-mode).  Each type of regulator
+ * supports a subset of the possible modes.
+ *
+ * %RPMH_REGULATOR_MODE_RET:	Retention mode in which only an extremely small
+ *				load current is allowed.  This mode is supported
+ *				by LDO and SMPS type regulators.
+ * %RPMH_REGULATOR_MODE_LPM:	Low power mode in which a small load current is
+ *				allowed.  This mode corresponds to PFM for SMPS
+ *				and BOB type regulators.  This mode is supported
+ *				by LDO, HFSMPS, BOB, and PMIC4 FTSMPS type
+ *				regulators.
+ * %RPMH_REGULATOR_MODE_AUTO:	Auto mode in which the regulator hardware
+ *				automatically switches between LPM and HPM based
+ *				upon the real-time load current.  This mode is
+ *				supported by HFSMPS, BOB, and PMIC4 FTSMPS type
+ *				regulators.
+ * %RPMH_REGULATOR_MODE_HPM:	High power mode in which the full rated current
+ *				of the regulator is allowed.  This mode
+ *				corresponds to PWM for SMPS and BOB type
+ *				regulators.  This mode is supported by all types
+ *				of regulators.
