commit 5356e0da49e61e0de29a5f61996be66e97425217

    regulator: max77802: Add header for operating modes
    
    Add a header file for the max77802 constants that could be shared between
    the regulator driver and Device Tree source files. Also, remove standby
    and off opmodes since only normal and low power are valid operating modes.
