commit e581245d8aaf897870afacd4aaf2bbce77cf1f1e

    clk: max77686: Add DT binding details for PMIC MAX77620
    
    Maxim has used the same clock IP on multiple PMICs like MAX77686,
    MAX77802, MAX77620. Only differences are the number of clocks
    from these PMICs like MAX77686 has 3 clocks output, MAX776802 have
    two clock output and MAX77620 has one clock output.
    
    Add clock binding details and DT example for the MAX77620.
