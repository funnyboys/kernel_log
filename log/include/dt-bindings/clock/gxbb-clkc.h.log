    Merge tag 'clk-for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/clk/linux
    
    Pull clk updates from Stephen Boyd:
     "We have two changes to the core framework this time around.
    
      The first being a large change that introduces runtime PM support to
      the clk framework. Now we properly call runtime PM operations on the
      device providing a clk when the clk is in use. This helps on SoCs
      where the clks provided by a device need something to be powered on
      before using the clks, like power domains or regulators. It also helps
      power those things down when clks aren't in use.
    
      The other core change is a devm API addition for clk providers so we
      can get rid of a bunch of clk driver remove functions that are just
      doing of_clk_del_provider().
    
      Outside of the core, we have the usual addition of clk drivers and
      smattering of non-critical fixes to existing drivers. The biggest diff
      is support for Mediatek MT2712 and MT7622 SoCs, but those patches
      really just add a bunch of data.
    
      By the way, we're trying something new here where we build the tree up
      with topic branches. We plan to work this into our workflow so that we
      don't step on each other's toes, and so the fixes branch can be merged
      on an as-needed basis.
    
      Summary:
    
      Core:
       - runtime PM support for clk providers
       - devm API for of_clk_add_hw_provider()
    
      New Drivers:
       - Mediatek MT2712 and MT7622
       - Renesas R-Car V3M SoC

       - runtime PM support for Samsung exynos5433/exynos4412 providers
       - removal of clkdev aliases on Samsung SoCs
       - convert clk-gpio to use gpio descriptors
       - various driver cleanups to match kernel coding style
       - Amlogic Video Processing Unit VPU and VAPB clks
       - sigma-delta modulation for Allwinner audio PLLs
       - Allwinner A83t Display clks
       - support for the second display unit clock on Renesas RZ/G1E
       - suspend/resume support for Renesas R-Car Gen3 CPG/MSSR
       - new clock ids for Rockchip rk3188 and rk3368 SoCs
       - various 'const' markings on clk_ops structures

commit b24413180f5600bcb3bb70fbed5cf186b60864bd
Author: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 1 15:07:57 2017 +0100

    License cleanup: add SPDX GPL-2.0 license identifier to files with no license
    
    Many source files in the tree are missing licensing information, which
    makes it harder for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default all files without license information are under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPL version 2.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with the 'GPL-2.0'
    SPDX license identifier.  The SPDX identifier is a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.
    
    How this work was done:
    
    Patches were generated and checked against linux-4.14-rc6 for a subset of
    the use cases:
     - file had no licensing information it it.
     - file was a */uapi/* one with no licensing information in it,
     - file was a */uapi/* one with existing licensing information,
    
    Further patches will be generated in subsequent months to fix up cases
    where non-standard license headers were used, and references to license
    had to be inferred by heuristics based on keywords.
    
    The analysis to determine which SPDX License Identifier to be applied to
    a file was done in a spreadsheet of side by side results from of the
    output of two independent scanners (ScanCode & Windriver) producing SPDX
    tag:value files created by Philippe Ombredanne.  Philippe prepared the
    base worksheet, and did an initial spot review of a few 1000 files.
    
    The 4.13 kernel was the starting point of the analysis with 60,537 files
    assessed.  Kate Stewart did a file by file comparison of the scanner
    results in the spreadsheet to determine which SPDX license identifier(s)
    to be applied to the file. She confirmed any determination that was not
    immediately clear with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Criteria used to select files for SPDX license identifier tagging was:
     - Files considered eligible had to be source code files.
     - Make and config files were included as candidates if they contained >5
       lines of source
     - File already had some variant of a license header in it (even if <5
       lines).
    
    All documentation files were explicitly excluded.
    
    The following heuristics were used to determine which SPDX license
    identifiers to apply.
    
     - when both scanners couldn't find any license traces, file was
       considered to have no license information in it, and the top level
       COPYING file license applied.
    
       For non */uapi/* files that summary was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0                                              11139
    
       and resulted in the first patch in this series.
    
       If that file was a */uapi/* path one, it was "GPL-2.0 WITH
       Linux-syscall-note" otherwise it was "GPL-2.0".  Results of that was:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|-------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        930
    
       and resulted in the second patch in this series.
    
     - if a file had some form of licensing information in it, and was one
       of the */uapi/* ones, it was denoted with the Linux-syscall-note if
       any GPL family license was found in the file or had no licensing in
       it (per prior point).  Results summary:
    
       SPDX license identifier                            # files
       ---------------------------------------------------|------
       GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note                       270
       GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      169
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-2-Clause)    21
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    17
       LGPL-2.1+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                      15
       GPL-1.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       14
       ((GPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR BSD-3-Clause)    5
       LGPL-2.0+ WITH Linux-syscall-note                       4
       LGPL-2.1 WITH Linux-syscall-note                        3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT)              3
       ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT)             1
    
       and that resulted in the third patch in this series.
    
     - when the two scanners agreed on the detected license(s), that became
       the concluded license(s).
    
     - when there was disagreement between the two scanners (one detected a
       license but the other didn't, or they both detected different
       licenses) a manual inspection of the file occurred.
    
     - In most cases a manual inspection of the information in the file
       resulted in a clear resolution of the license that should apply (and
       which scanner probably needed to revisit its heuristics).
    
     - When it was not immediately clear, the license identifier was
       confirmed with lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
     - If there was any question as to the appropriate license identifier,
       the file was flagged for further research and to be revisited later
       in time.
    
    In total, over 70 hours of logged manual review was done on the
    spreadsheet to determine the SPDX license identifiers to apply to the
    source files by Kate, Philippe, Thomas and, in some cases, confirmation
    by lawyers working with the Linux Foundation.
    
    Kate also obtained a third independent scan of the 4.13 code base from
    FOSSology, and compared selected files where the other two scanners
    disagreed against that SPDX file, to see if there was new insights.  The
    Windriver scanner is based on an older version of FOSSology in part, so
    they are related.
    
    Thomas did random spot checks in about 500 files from the spreadsheets
    for the uapi headers and agreed with SPDX license identifier in the
    files he inspected. For the non-uapi files Thomas did random spot checks
    in about 15000 files.
    
    In initial set of patches against 4.14-rc6, 3 files were found to have
    copy/paste license identifier errors, and have been fixed to reflect the
    correct identifier.
    
    Additionally Philippe spent 10 hours this week doing a detailed manual
    inspection and review of the 12,461 patched files from the initial patch
    version early this week with:
     - a full scancode scan run, collecting the matched texts, detected
       license ids and scores
     - reviewing anything where there was a license detected (about 500+
       files) to ensure that the applied SPDX license was correct
     - reviewing anything where there was no detection but the patch license
       was not GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note to ensure that the applied
       SPDX license was correct
    
    This produced a worksheet with 20 files needing minor correction.  This
    worksheet was then exported into 3 different .csv files for the
    different types of files to be modified.
    
    These .csv files were then reviewed by Greg.  Thomas wrote a script to
    parse the csv files and add the proper SPDX tag to the file, in the
    format that the file expected.  This script was further refined by Greg
    based on the output to detect more types of files automatically and to
    distinguish between header and source .c files (which need different
    comment types.)  Finally Greg ran the script using the .csv files to
    generate the patches.

    clk: meson-gxbb: un-export the CPU clock
    
    The CPU clock defined in the Meson GX clock driver is actually a
    left-over from the Meson8b clock controller. Un-export the clock so we
    can remove it from the driver.

commit 33d0fcdfe0e87070d96c678e554d711ae15b9fa6
Author: Martin Blumenstingl <martin.blumenstingl@googlemail.com>
Date:   Thu Jan 19 15:58:20 2017 +0100

    clk: gxbb: add the SAR ADC clocks and expose them
    
    The HHI_SAR_CLK_CNTL contains three SAR ADC specific clocks:
    - a mux clock to choose between different ADC reference clocks (this is
      2-bit wide, but the datasheet only lists the parents for the first
      bit)
    - a divider for the input/reference clock
    - a gate which enables the ADC clock
    
    Additionally this exposes the ADC core clock (CLKID_SAR_ADC) and
    CLKID_SANA (which seems to enable the analog inputs, but unfortunately
    there is no documentation for this - we just mimic what the vendor
    driver does).

    This reverts commit e16fb2e6355c1c1b41623af9e01ada196e2af098.
    
    Updated documentation from the chip vendor reveals that this clock is
    not required for correct operation of the MMC controller. As such, do
    not expose it to DT.

    clk: gxbb: add AmLogic GXBB clk controller driver
    
    The gxbb clock controller is the primary clock generation unit for the
    AmLogic GXBB SoC. It is clocked by a fixed 24MHz xtal, contains several
    PLLs and the usual post-dividers, muxes, dividers and leaf gates that
    are fed into various IP blocks in the SoC.
