    These compatible strings need to be added to extend support
    for the RPM CC to cover MSM8660/APQ8060. We also need to add
    enumberators to the include file for a few clocks that were
    missing.

Date:   Wed Nov 2 17:56:56 2016 +0200

    clk: qcom: Add support for SMD-RPM Clocks
    
    This adds initial support for clocks controlled by the Resource
    Power Manager (RPM) processor on some Qualcomm SoCs, which use
    the qcom_smd_rpm driver to communicate with RPM.
    Such platforms are msm8916, apq8084 and msm8974.
    
    The RPM is a dedicated hardware engine for managing the shared
    SoC resources in order to keep the lowest power profile. It
    communicates with other hardware subsystems via shared memory
    and accepts clock requests, aggregates the requests and turns
    the clocks on/off or scales them on demand.
    
    This driver is based on the codeaurora.org driver:
