    clk: sunxi-ng: add support for H6 PRCM CCU
    
    The H6 has clock/reset controls in PRCM part, like old SoCs such as H3
    and A64. However, the PRCM CCU is rearranged; the register arragement
    is now similar to the main CCU of H6, and the PRCM now has two APB
    buses to control -- one is clocked from AHB clock derivde from AR100
    clock, the other is clocked from the same mux with AR100 clock.
    Therefore a new driver is written for it.
    
    As there's no official document about the PRCM in H6, all the information
    are indirectly collected from BSP and parts of the document, and the
    information source is noted as comments in the driver's source code. If
    reliable information is provided furtherly, the driver needs to be
    rechecked.
