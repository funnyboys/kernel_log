    clk: cygnus: add clock support for Broadcom Cygnus
    
    The Broadcom Cygnus SoC is architected under the iProc architecture. It
    has the following PLLs: ARMPLL, GENPLL, LCPLL0, MIPIPLL, all dervied
    from an onboard crystal. Cygnus also has various ASIU clocks that are
    derived directly from the onboard crystal.
