    clk: samsung: add clock controller driver for s3c2410, s3c2440 and s3c2442
    
    This driver can handle the clock controllers of the socs mentioned above,
    as they share a common clock tree with only small differences.
    
    The clock structure is built according to the manuals of the included
    SoCs and might include changes in comparison to the previous clock
    structure.
    
    As pll-rate-tables only the 12mhz variants are currently included.
    The original code was wrongly checking for 169mhz xti values [a 0 to much
    at the end], so the original 16mhz pll table would have never been
    included and its values are so obscure that I have no possibility to
    at least check their sane-ness. When using the formula from the manual
    the resulting frequency is near the table value but still slightly off.
