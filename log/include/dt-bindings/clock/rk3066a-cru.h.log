    clk: rockchip: add missing include guards
    
    Review for the rk3368 turned up that the clock header was missing include
    guards. This is also true for the already existing clock binding headers,
    so add them.

commit 2c14736c75dba10d9da4c8337e1baee11577691c
Author: Heiko St√ºbner <heiko@sntech.de>
Date:   Thu Jul 3 02:01:14 2014 +0200

    clk: rockchip: add clock driver for rk3188 and rk3066 clocks
    
    This adds a clock driver that handles the specific muxes, dividers and gates
    of rk3188 and rk3066 SoCs.
    
    The structure of the clock list resembles the arrangement of their
    counterparts in the clock architecture diagrams found in the SoC
    documentation.
    
    Clocks exported to the clock provider are currently limited to well known
    or measured ones. So additional clock exports may be necessary in the future.
