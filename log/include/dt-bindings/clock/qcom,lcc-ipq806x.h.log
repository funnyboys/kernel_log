commit 2a5cfec947c788d19ef60cb12722d4c336d44482
Author: Rajendra Nayak <rnayak@codeaurora.org>
Date:   Mon Jan 19 18:05:32 2015 -0800

    dt-bindings: Add #defines for IPQ806x lpass clock control
    
    Add defines to make more human readable numbers for the lpass
    clock controller found on IPQ806x SoCs. Also remove the PLL4
    define in gcc to avoid #define conflicts because that clock
    doesn't exist in gcc, instead it lives in lcc.
