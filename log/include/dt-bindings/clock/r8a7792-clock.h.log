commit 7b39e985cfc18bba43646240b10a830046382abf
Author: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert+renesas@glider.be>
Date:   Mon Apr 3 11:53:08 2017 +0200

    ARM: dts: r8a7792: Correct Z clock
    
    Unlike other R-Car Gen2 SoCs with Cortex-A15 CPU cores, R-Car V2H does
    not have a programmable Z clock (Cortex-A15 CPU core clock), but uses a
    fixed divider.
    This is similar to the Z2 clock (Cortex-A7 CPU core clock) on R-Car E2.
    
    Hence:
      - Remove the Z clock output from the cpg_clocks node, as this implied
        a programmable clock,
      - Add the Z clock as a fixed factor clock,
      - Let the first CPU node point to the new Z clock,
      - Remove the Z clock index from the bindings (this definition was used
        by r8a7792.dtsi only, and was not a contract between DT and driver).

    ARM: dts: r8a7792: Add INTC-SYS clock to device tree
    
    Link the ARM GIC to the INTC-SYS module clock, and add it to the "always
    on" PM Domain, so it can be power managed using that clock.
    
    Note that currently the GIC-400 driver doesn't support module clocks nor
    Runtime PM, so this must be handled as a critical clock.

    ARM: dts: r8a7792: remove ADSP clock
    
    Simon Horman told me that R8A7792 has ADSP clock based on an incorrect
    table in the most recent R-Car gen2 manual. But when I received that manual
    I discovered that this is false: R8A7792 is the only Gen 2 SoC that doesn't
    have ADSP at all.  Accordingly remove the ADSP clock from DT for the
    r8a7792.
