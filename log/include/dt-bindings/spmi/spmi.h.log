    spmi: Linux driver framework for SPMI
    
    System Power Management Interface (SPMI) is a specification
    developed by the MIPI (Mobile Industry Process Interface) Alliance
    optimized for the real time control of Power Management ICs (PMIC).
    
    SPMI is a two-wire serial interface that supports up to 4 master
    devices and up to 16 logical slaves.
    
    The framework supports message APIs, multiple busses (1 controller
    per bus) and multiple clients/slave devices per controller.
