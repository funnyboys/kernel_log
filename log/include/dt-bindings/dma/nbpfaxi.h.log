commit 94c7b6fc7cd1b29d987592ce7eecd902f6728db4
Author: Guennadi Liakhovetski <g.liakhovetski@gmx.de>
Date:   Sat Jul 19 12:48:45 2014 +0200

    dmaengine: add device tree binding documentation for the nbpfaxi driver
    
    The nbpfaxi dmaengine driver doesn't define any new bindings, it only
    uses standard dmaengine bindings and defines 3 flags for the 3rd parameter
    of the "dmas" property.
