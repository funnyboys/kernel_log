commit a3828519c39aa9c85bae14bad2572d12dc0d1da6
Author: Andrew F. Davis <afd@ti.com>

    Documentation: dt: reset: Add TI syscon reset binding
    
    Add TI syscon reset controller binding. This will hook to the reset
    framework and use syscon/regmap to set reset bits. This allows reset
    control of individual SoC subsytems and devices with memory-mapped
    reset registers in a common register memory space.
