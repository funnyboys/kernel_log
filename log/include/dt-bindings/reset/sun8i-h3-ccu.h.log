    clk: sunxi-ng: add Allwinner H5 CCU support for H3 CCU driver
    
    Allwinner H5 is a SoC that features a design which keeps the peripheral
    compatible with H3, so that it have also a CCU like the one on H3 --
    only one bus gate/reset is added, and the mmc sample/output phases are
    removed because of MMC controller update.
    
    Add its support in our existing H3 CCU driver.
