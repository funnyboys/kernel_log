commit 5e73761786d6ff7e10c371703835528dee9306e3
Author: Maxime Ripard <maxime.ripard@free-electrons.com>

    clk: sunxi-ng: Add sun5i CCU driver
    
    The Allwinner A10s, A13, R8 and NextThing GR8 are all based on the same
    silicon, and all share the same clocks.
    
    However, they're not packaged in the same way, and therefore not all the
    controllers are actually available on all these SoCs.
    
    Introduce a clock controller driver for all these SoCs with different
    compatibles to take that into account.
