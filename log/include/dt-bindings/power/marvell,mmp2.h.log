    dt-bindings: marvell,mmp2: Add ids for the power domains
    
    On MMP2 the audio and GPU blocks are on separate power islands. On MMP3
    the camera block's power is also controlled separately.
    
    Add the numbers that we could use to refer to the power domains for
    respective power islands from the device tree.
