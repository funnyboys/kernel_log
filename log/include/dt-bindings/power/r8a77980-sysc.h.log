    soc: renesas: r8a77980-sysc: Correct A3VIP[012] power domain hierarchy
    
    The R-Car Gen3 HardWare Manual Errata for Rev. 0.80 (Feb 28, 2018)
    renamed the A3VIP power domain on R-Car V3H to A3VIP0, and clarified the
    power domain hierarchy for the A3VIP[012] power domains.
    
    As the definition for the A3VIP0 domain is not yet used from DT, it can
    just be renamed.

    Fixes: 41d6d8bd8ae94ca9 ("soc: renesas: rcar-sysc: add R8A77980 support")

    soc: renesas: r8a77980-sysc: Correct names of A2DP[01] power domains
    
    The R-Car Gen3 HardWare Manual Errata for Rev. 0.80 (Feb 28, 2018)
    renamed the A2PD0 and A2DP0 power domains on R-Car V3H to A2DP0 resp.
    A2DP1.
    
    As these definitions are not yet used from DT, they can just be renamed.

    dt-bindings: power: add R8A77980 SYSC power domain definitions
    
    Add macros usable by the device tree sources to reference R8A77980 SYSC
    power domains by index.
    
    Based on the original (and large) patch by Vladimir Barinov.
