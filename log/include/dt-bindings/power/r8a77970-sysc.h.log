commit b5eb730e031acaba2d25e8f522ac5966a70885ae
Author: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert+renesas@glider.be>
Date:   Thu Nov 29 11:56:16 2018 +0100

    soc: renesas: r8a77970-sysc: Correct names of A2DP/A2CN power domains
    
    The R-Car Gen3 HardWare Manual Errata for Rev. 0.80 (Feb 28, 2018)
    renamed the A2IR2 and A2IR3 power domains on R-Car V3M to A2DP resp.
    A2CN.
    
    As these definitions are not yet used from DT, they can just be renamed.
    
    While at it, fix the indentation of the A3IR definition.

    soc: renesas: r8a77970-sysc: Remove non-existent CR7 power domain
    
    The R-Car Gen3 HardWare Manual Errata for Rev. 0.80 (Feb 28, 2018)
    removed the CR7 power domain on R-Car V3M, as this SoC does not have an
    ARM Cortex-R7 Realtime Core.
    
    As this definition was never used from DT, it can just be removed.
