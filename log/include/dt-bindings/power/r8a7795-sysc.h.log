commit fcb87087261e1be51b4c03677f39246bdc312b1c
Author: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert+renesas@glider.be>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 11:01:56 2017 +0200

    soc: renesas: rcar-sysc: Add support for R-Car H3 ES2.0
    
    Power area A2VC0 was removed in revision ES2.0, cfr. R-Car Gen3 Hardware
    User's Manual rev. 0.53E.
    
    Hence remove it from the power area table when not running on ES1.x.
    
    This is in line with the goal to:
      1. Support both the ES1.x and ES2.0 SoC revisions in a single binary
         for now,
      2. Make it clear which code supports ES1.x, so it can easily be
         identified and removed later, when production SoCs are deemed
         ubiquitous.
