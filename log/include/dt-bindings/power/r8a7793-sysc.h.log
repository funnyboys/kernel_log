commit a6171412725e4e7e510a2b91a1d79dbc2ef0e679
Author: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert+renesas@glider.be>
Date:   Wed Apr 13 16:44:21 2016 +0200

    soc: renesas: Add r8a7793 SYSC PM Domain Binding Definitions
    
    R-Car M2-N is identical to R-Car M2-W w.r.t. power domains, so reuse the
    definitions from the latter.
