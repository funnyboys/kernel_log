    MIPS: lantiq: Add a GPHY driver which uses the RCU syscon-mfd
    
    Compared to the old xrx200_phy_fw driver the new version has multiple
    enhancements. The name of the firmware files does not have to be added
    to all .dts files anymore - one now configures the GPHY mode (FE or GE)
    instead. Each GPHY can now also boot separate firmware (thus mixing of
    GE and FE GPHYs is now possible).
    The new implementation is based on the RCU syscon-mfd and uses the
    reeset_controller framework instead of raw RCU register reads/writes.
