    drm: Add helper to create a connector for a chain of bridges
    
    Most bridge drivers create a DRM connector to model the connector at the
    output of the bridge. This model is historical and has worked pretty
    well so far, but causes several issues:
    
    - It prevents supporting more complex display pipelines where DRM
    connector operations are split over multiple components. For instance a
    pipeline with a bridge connected to the DDC signals to read EDID data,
    and another one connected to the HPD signal to detect connection and
    disconnection, will not be possible to support through this model.
    
    - It requires every bridge driver to implement similar connector
    handling code, resulting in code duplication.
    
    - It assumes that a bridge will either be wired to a connector or to
    another bridge, but doesn't support bridges that can be used in both
    positions very well (although there is some ad-hoc support for this in
    the analogix_dp bridge driver).
    
    In order to solve these issues, ownership of the connector needs to be
    moved to the display controller driver.
    
    To avoid code duplication in display controller drivers, add a new
    helper to create and manage a DRM connector backed by a chain of
    bridges. All connector operations are delegating to the appropriate
    bridge in the chain.
