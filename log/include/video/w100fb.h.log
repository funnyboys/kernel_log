    [PATCH] SharpSL: Abstract c7x0 specifics from Corgi Touchscreen driver
    
    Separate out the Sharp Zaurus c7x0 series specific code from the Corgi
    Touchscreen driver.  Use the new functions in corgi_lcd.c via sharpsl.h for
    hsync handling and pass the IRQ as a platform device resource.  Move a
    function prototype into the w100fb header file where it belongs.
    
    This enables the driver to be used by the Zaurus cxx00 series.

    [PATCH] w100fb: Rewrite for platform independence
    
    The code w100fb was based on was horribly Sharp SL-C7x0 specific and there
    was little else that could be done as I had no access to anything else with
    a w100 in it.  There is no real documentation about this chipset available.
    
    Ian Molton has access to other platforms with the w100 (Toshiba e-series)
    and so between us, we've improved w100fb and made it platform independent.
    Ian Molton also added support for the very similar w3220 and w3200
    chipsets.
    
    There are a lot of changes here and it nearly amounts to a rewrite of the
    driver but it has been extensively tested and is being used in preference
    to the original driver in the Zaurus community.  I'd therefore like to
    update the mainline code to reflect this.

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
