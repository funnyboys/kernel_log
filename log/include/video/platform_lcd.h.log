commit 46e1915eef9c0e935a09808a30e167abb857b4ec
Author: Andrew Bresticker <abrestic@chromium.org>
Date:   Mon Apr 29 16:17:58 2013 -0700

    drivers/video/backlight/platform_lcd.c: introduce probe callback
    
    Platform LCD devices may need to do some device-specific initialization
    before they can be used (regulator or GPIO setup, for example), but
    currently the driver does not support any way of doing this.  This patch
    adds a probe() callback to plat_lcd_data which platform LCD devices can
    set to indicate that device-specific initialization is needed.
