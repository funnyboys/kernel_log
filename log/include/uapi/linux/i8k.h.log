    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with a license
    
    Many user space API headers have licensing information, which is either
    incomplete, badly formatted or just a shorthand for referring to the
    license under which the file is supposed to be.  This makes it hard for
    compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    Update these files with an SPDX license identifier.  The identifier was
    chosen based on the license information in the file.
    
    GPL/LGPL licensed headers get the matching GPL/LGPL SPDX license
    identifier with the added 'WITH Linux-syscall-note' exception, which is
    the officially assigned exception identifier for the kernel syscall
    exception:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    This exception makes it possible to include GPL headers into non GPL
    code, without confusing license compliance tools.
    
    Headers which have either explicit dual licensing or are just licensed
    under a non GPL license are updated with the corresponding SPDX
    identifier and the GPLv2 with syscall exception identifier.  The format
    is:
            ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR SPDX-ID-OF-OTHER-LICENSE)
    
    SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding shorthand, which can be
    used instead of the full boiler plate text.  The update does not remove
    existing license information as this has to be done on a case by case
    basis and the copyright holders might have to be consulted. This will
    happen in a separate step.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.

    i8k: uapi: Introduce define for new highest fan speed
    
    Some Dell laptops support fan speeds of {0, 1, 2, 3} instead of {0, 1, 2}.
    Add a define for it.
