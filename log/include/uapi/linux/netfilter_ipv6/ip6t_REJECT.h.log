    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with no license
    
    Many user space API headers are missing licensing information, which
    makes it hard for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default are files without license information under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPLV2.  Marking them GPLV2 would exclude
    them from being included in non GPLV2 code, which is obviously not
    intended. The user space API headers fall under the syscall exception
    which is in the kernels COPYING file:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    otherwise syscall usage would not be possible.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with an SPDX
    license identifier.  The chosen identifier is 'GPL-2.0 WITH
    Linux-syscall-note' which is the officially assigned identifier for the
    Linux syscall exception.  SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.

commit 1afe839e6b31a85fc53adbf8757d6373908d414d
Author: Andreas Herz <andi@geekosphere.org>

    netfilter: ip6t_REJECT: added missing icmpv6 codes
    
    RFC 4443 added two new codes values for ICMPv6 type 1:
    
     5 - Source address failed ingress/egress policy
     6 - Reject route to destination
    
    And RFC 7084 states in L-14 that IPv6 Router MUST send ICMPv6 Destination
    Unreachable with code 5 for packets forwarded to it that use an address
    from a prefix that has been invalidated.
    
    Codes 5 and 6 are more informative subsets of code 1.
