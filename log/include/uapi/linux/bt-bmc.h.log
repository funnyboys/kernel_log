    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with a license
    
    Many user space API headers have licensing information, which is either
    incomplete, badly formatted or just a shorthand for referring to the
    license under which the file is supposed to be.  This makes it hard for
    compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    Update these files with an SPDX license identifier.  The identifier was
    chosen based on the license information in the file.
    
    GPL/LGPL licensed headers get the matching GPL/LGPL SPDX license
    identifier with the added 'WITH Linux-syscall-note' exception, which is
    the officially assigned exception identifier for the kernel syscall
    exception:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    This exception makes it possible to include GPL headers into non GPL
    code, without confusing license compliance tools.
    
    Headers which have either explicit dual licensing or are just licensed
    under a non GPL license are updated with the corresponding SPDX
    identifier and the GPLv2 with syscall exception identifier.  The format
    is:
            ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR SPDX-ID-OF-OTHER-LICENSE)
    
    SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding shorthand, which can be
    used instead of the full boiler plate text.  The update does not remove
    existing license information as this has to be done on a case by case
    basis and the copyright holders might have to be consulted. This will
    happen in a separate step.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.

    ipmi: add an Aspeed BT IPMI BMC driver
    
    This patch adds a simple device driver to expose the iBT interface on
    Aspeed SOCs (AST2400 and AST2500) as a character device. Such SOCs are
    commonly used as BMCs (BaseBoard Management Controllers) and this
    driver implements the BMC side of the BT interface.
    
    The BT (Block Transfer) interface is used to perform in-band IPMI
    communication between a host and its BMC. Entire messages are buffered
    before sending a notification to the other end, host or BMC, that
    there is data to be read. Usually, the host emits requests and the BMC
    responses but the specification provides a mean for the BMC to send
    SMS Attention (BMC-to-Host attention or System Management Software
    attention) messages.
    
    For this purpose, the driver introduces a specific ioctl on the
    device: 'BT_BMC_IOCTL_SMS_ATN' that can be used by the system running
    on the BMC to signal the host of such an event.
    
    The device name defaults to '/dev/ipmi-bt-host'

          - added a devicetree binding documentation
          - replace 'bt_host' by 'bt_bmc' to reflect that the driver is
            the BMC side of the IPMI BT interface
          - renamed the device to 'ipmi-bt-host'
          - introduced a temporary buffer to copy_{to,from}_user
          - used platform_get_irq()
          - moved the driver under drivers/char/ipmi/ but kept it as a misc
            device
