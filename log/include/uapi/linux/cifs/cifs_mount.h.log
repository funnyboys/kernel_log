    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with a license
    
    Many user space API headers have licensing information, which is either
    incomplete, badly formatted or just a shorthand for referring to the
    license under which the file is supposed to be.  This makes it hard for
    compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    Update these files with an SPDX license identifier.  The identifier was
    chosen based on the license information in the file.
    
    GPL/LGPL licensed headers get the matching GPL/LGPL SPDX license
    identifier with the added 'WITH Linux-syscall-note' exception, which is
    the officially assigned exception identifier for the kernel syscall
    exception:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    This exception makes it possible to include GPL headers into non GPL
    code, without confusing license compliance tools.
    
    Headers which have either explicit dual licensing or are just licensed
    under a non GPL license are updated with the corresponding SPDX
    identifier and the GPLv2 with syscall exception identifier.  The format
    is:
            ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR SPDX-ID-OF-OTHER-LICENSE)
    
    SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding shorthand, which can be
    used instead of the full boiler plate text.  The update does not remove
    existing license information as this has to be done on a case by case
    basis and the copyright holders might have to be consulted. This will
    happen in a separate step.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.

    cifs: Move and expand MAX_SERVER_SIZE definition
    
    MAX_SERVER_SIZE has been moved to cifs_mount.h and renamed
    CIFS_NI_MAXHOST for clarity.  It has been expanded to 1024 as the
    previous value of 16 was very short.

    cifs: Expand max share name length to 256
    
    The old max share name length limit was 80 due to Windows NET SHARE
    command not allowing more than that.  However, share names can be much
    longer.  This is a more reasonable maximum share name length.

    cifs: Move string length definitions to uapi
    
    The max string length definitions for user name, domain name, password,
    and share name have been moved into their own header file in uapi so the
    mount helper can use autoconf to define them instead of keeping the
    kernel side and userland side definitions in sync manually.  The names
    have also been standardized with a "CIFS" prefix and "LEN" suffix.
