    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with no license
    
    Many user space API headers are missing licensing information, which
    makes it hard for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default are files without license information under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPLV2.  Marking them GPLV2 would exclude
    them from being included in non GPLV2 code, which is obviously not
    intended. The user space API headers fall under the syscall exception
    which is in the kernels COPYING file:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    otherwise syscall usage would not be possible.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with an SPDX
    license identifier.  The chosen identifier is 'GPL-2.0 WITH
    Linux-syscall-note' which is the officially assigned identifier for the
    Linux syscall exception.  SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.

    ipv6: sr: add code base for control plane support of SR-IPv6
    
    This patch adds the necessary hooks and structures to provide support
    for SR-IPv6 control plane, essentially the Generic Netlink commands
    that will be used for userspace control over the Segment Routing
    kernel structures.
    
    The genetlink commands provide control over two different structures:
    tunnel source and HMAC data. The tunnel source is the source address
    that will be used by default when encapsulating packets into an
    outer IPv6 header + SRH. If the tunnel source is set to :: then an
    address of the outgoing interface will be selected as the source.
    
    The HMAC commands currently just return ENOTSUPP and will be implemented
    in a future patch.
