    linux/kernel.h: split *_MAX and *_MIN macros into <linux/limits.h>
    
    <linux/kernel.h> tends to be cluttered because we often put various sort
    of unrelated stuff in it.  So, we have split out a sensible chunk of
    code into a separate header from time to time.
    
    This commit splits out the *_MAX and *_MIN defines.
    
    The standard header <limits.h> contains various MAX, MIN constants
    including numerial limits.  [1]
    
    I think it makes sense to move in-kernel MAX, MIN constants into
    include/linux/limits.h.
    
    We already have include/uapi/linux/limits.h to contain some user-space
    constants.  I changed its include guard to _UAPI_LINUX_LIMITS_H.  This
    change has no impact to the user-space because
    scripts/headers_install.sh rips off the '_UAPI' prefix from the include
    guards of exported headers.

commit 6f52b16c5b29b89d92c0e7236f4655dc8491ad70

    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with no license
    
    Many user space API headers are missing licensing information, which
    makes it hard for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default are files without license information under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPLV2.  Marking them GPLV2 would exclude
    them from being included in non GPLV2 code, which is obviously not
    intended. The user space API headers fall under the syscall exception
    which is in the kernels COPYING file:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    otherwise syscall usage would not be possible.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with an SPDX
    license identifier.  The chosen identifier is 'GPL-2.0 WITH
    Linux-syscall-note' which is the officially assigned identifier for the
    Linux syscall exception.  SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.
