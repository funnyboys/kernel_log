    net: Move all TC actions identifiers to one place
    
    Move all the TC identifiers to one place, to the same enum that defines
    the identifier of police action. This makes it easier choose numbers for
    new actions since they are now defined in one place. We preserve the
    original values for binary compatibility. New IDs should be added inside
    the enum.

    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with no license
    
    Many user space API headers are missing licensing information, which
    makes it hard for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default are files without license information under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPLV2.  Marking them GPLV2 would exclude
    them from being included in non GPLV2 code, which is obviously not
    intended. The user space API headers fall under the syscall exception
    which is in the kernels COPYING file:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    otherwise syscall usage would not be possible.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with an SPDX
    license identifier.  The chosen identifier is 'GPL-2.0 WITH
    Linux-syscall-note' which is the officially assigned identifier for the
    Linux syscall exception.  SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.

commit 22a5dc0e5e3e8fef804230cd73ed7b0afd4c7bae
Author: Felix Fietkau <nbd@openwrt.org>

    net: sched: Introduce connmark action
    
    This tc action allows you to retrieve the connection tracking mark
    This action has been used heavily by openwrt for a few years now.
    
    There are known limitations currently:
    
    doesn't work for initial packets, since we only query the ct table.
      Fine given use case is for returning packets
    
    no implicit defrag.
      frags should be rare so fix later..
    
    won't work for more complex tasks, e.g. lookup of other extensions
      since we have no means to store results
    
    we still have a 2nd lookup later on via normal conntrack path.
    This shouldn't break anything though since skb->nfct isn't altered.
    
    V2:
    remove unnecessary braces (Jiri)
    change the action identifier to 14 (Jiri)
    Fix some stylistic issues caught by checkpatch
    V3:
    Move module params to bottom (Cong)
    Get rid of tcf_hashinfo_init and friends and conform to newer API (Cong)
