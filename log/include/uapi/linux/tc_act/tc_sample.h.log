    net: Move all TC actions identifiers to one place
    
    Move all the TC identifiers to one place, to the same enum that defines
    the identifier of police action. This makes it easier choose numbers for
    new actions since they are now defined in one place. We preserve the
    original values for binary compatibility. New IDs should be added inside
    the enum.

    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with no license
    
    Many user space API headers are missing licensing information, which
    makes it hard for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default are files without license information under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPLV2.  Marking them GPLV2 would exclude
    them from being included in non GPLV2 code, which is obviously not
    intended. The user space API headers fall under the syscall exception
    which is in the kernels COPYING file:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    otherwise syscall usage would not be possible.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with an SPDX
    license identifier.  The chosen identifier is 'GPL-2.0 WITH
    Linux-syscall-note' which is the officially assigned identifier for the
    Linux syscall exception.  SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.

    net/sched: Introduce sample tc action
    
    This action allows the user to sample traffic matched by tc classifier.
    The sampling consists of choosing packets randomly and sampling them using
    the psample module. The user can configure the psample group number, the
    sampling rate and the packet's truncation (to save kernel-user traffic).
    
    Example:
    To sample ingress traffic from interface eth1, one may use the commands:
    
    tc qdisc add dev eth1 handle ffff: ingress
    
    tc filter add dev eth1 parent ffff: \
               matchall action sample rate 12 group 4
    
    Where the first command adds an ingress qdisc and the second starts
    sampling randomly with an average of one sampled packet per 12 packets on
    dev eth1 to psample group 4.
