    rpmsg: char: Switch to SPDX license identifier
    
    Use the appropriate SPDX license identifier in the rpmsg char driver
    source file and drop the previous boilerplate license text. The uapi
    header file already had the SPDX license identifier added as part of
    a mass update but the license text removal was deferred for later,
    and this patch drops the same.

    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with a license
    
    Many user space API headers have licensing information, which is either
    incomplete, badly formatted or just a shorthand for referring to the
    license under which the file is supposed to be.  This makes it hard for
    compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    Update these files with an SPDX license identifier.  The identifier was
    chosen based on the license information in the file.
    
    GPL/LGPL licensed headers get the matching GPL/LGPL SPDX license
    identifier with the added 'WITH Linux-syscall-note' exception, which is
    the officially assigned exception identifier for the kernel syscall
    exception:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    This exception makes it possible to include GPL headers into non GPL
    code, without confusing license compliance tools.
    
    Headers which have either explicit dual licensing or are just licensed
    under a non GPL license are updated with the corresponding SPDX
    identifier and the GPLv2 with syscall exception identifier.  The format
    is:
            ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR SPDX-ID-OF-OTHER-LICENSE)
    
    SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding shorthand, which can be
    used instead of the full boiler plate text.  The update does not remove
    existing license information as this has to be done on a case by case
    basis and the copyright holders might have to be consulted. This will
    happen in a separate step.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.

commit c0cdc19f84a4712cf74888f83af286e3c2e14efd

    rpmsg: Driver for user space endpoint interface
    
    This driver allows rpmsg instances to expose access to rpmsg endpoints
    to user space processes. It provides a control interface, allowing
    userspace to export endpoints and an endpoint interface for each exposed
    endpoint.
    
    The implementation is based on prior art by Texas Instrument, Google,
    PetaLogix and was derived from a FreeRTOS performance statistics driver
    written by Michal Simek.
    
    The control interface provides a "create endpoint" ioctl, which is fed a
    name, source and destination address. The three values are used to
    create the endpoint, in a backend-specific way, and a rpmsg endpoint
    device is created - with the three parameters are available in sysfs for
    udev usage.
    
    E.g. to create an endpoint device for one of the Qualcomm SMD channel
    related to DIAG one would issue:
    
      struct rpmsg_endpoint_info info = { "DIAG_CNTL", 0, 0 };
      int fd = open("/dev/rpmsg_ctrl0", O_RDWR);
      ioctl(fd, RPMSG_CREATE_EPT_IOCTL, &info);
    
    Each created endpoint device shows up as an individual character device
    in /dev, allowing permission to be controlled on a per-endpoint basis.
    The rpmsg endpoint will be created and destroyed following the opening
    and closing of the endpoint device, allowing rpmsg backends to open and
    close the physical channel, if supported by the wire protocol.
