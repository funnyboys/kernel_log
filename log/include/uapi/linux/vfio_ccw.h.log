    vfio-ccw: Introduce a new CRW region
    
    This region provides a mechanism to pass a Channel Report Word
    that affect vfio-ccw devices, and needs to be passed to the guest
    for its awareness and/or processing.
    
    The base driver (see crw_collect_info()) provides space for two
    CRWs, as a subchannel event may have two CRWs chained together
    (one for the ssid, one for the subchannel).  As vfio-ccw will
    deal with everything at the subchannel level, provide space
    for a single CRW to be transferred in one shot.

    vfio-ccw: Introduce a new schib region
    
    The schib region can be used by userspace to get the subchannel-
    information block (SCHIB) for the passthrough subchannel.
    This can be useful to get information such as channel path
    information via the SCHIB.PMCW fields.

    vfio-ccw: add handling for async channel instructions
    
    Add a region to the vfio-ccw device that can be used to submit
    asynchronous I/O instructions. ssch continues to be handled by the
    existing I/O region; the new region handles hsch and csch.
    
    Interrupt status continues to be reported through the same channels
    as for ssch.

commit 6f52b16c5b29b89d92c0e7236f4655dc8491ad70

    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with no license
    
    Many user space API headers are missing licensing information, which
    makes it hard for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default are files without license information under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPLV2.  Marking them GPLV2 would exclude
    them from being included in non GPLV2 code, which is obviously not
    intended. The user space API headers fall under the syscall exception
    which is in the kernels COPYING file:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    otherwise syscall usage would not be possible.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with an SPDX
    license identifier.  The chosen identifier is 'GPL-2.0 WITH
    Linux-syscall-note' which is the officially assigned identifier for the
    Linux syscall exception.  SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.

    vfio: ccw: introduce ccw_io_region
    
    To provide user-space a set of interfaces to:
    1. pass in a ccw program to perform an I/O operation.
    2. read back I/O results of the completed I/O operations.
    We introduce an MMIO region for the vfio-ccw device here.
    
    This region is defined to content:
    1. areas to store arguments that an ssch required.
    2. areas to store the I/O results.
    
    Using pwrite/pread to the device on this region, a user-space program
    could write/read data to/from the vfio-ccw device.
