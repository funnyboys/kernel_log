    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with no license
    
    Many user space API headers are missing licensing information, which
    makes it hard for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default are files without license information under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPLV2.  Marking them GPLV2 would exclude
    them from being included in non GPLV2 code, which is obviously not
    intended. The user space API headers fall under the syscall exception
    which is in the kernels COPYING file:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    otherwise syscall usage would not be possible.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with an SPDX
    license identifier.  The chosen identifier is 'GPL-2.0 WITH
    Linux-syscall-note' which is the officially assigned identifier for the
    Linux syscall exception.  SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.

    netfilter: introduce l2tp match extension
    
    Introduce an xtables add-on for matching L2TP packets. Supports L2TPv2
    and L2TPv3 over IPv4 and IPv6. As well as filtering on L2TP tunnel-id
    and session-id, the filtering decision can also include the L2TP
    packet type (control or data), protocol version (2 or 3) and
    encapsulation type (UDP or IP).
    
    The most common use for this will likely be to filter L2TP data
    packets of individual L2TP tunnels or sessions. While a u32 match can
    be used, the L2TP protocol headers are such that field offsets differ
    depending on bits set in the header, making rules for matching generic
    L2TP connections cumbersome. This match extension takes care of all
    that.
