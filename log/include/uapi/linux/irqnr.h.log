    UAPI: Make uapi/linux/irqnr.h non-empty
    
    uapi/linux/irqnr.h was emitted by the UAPI disintegration script as an empty
    file because the parent linux/irqnr.h had no UAPI stuff in it, despite being
    marked with "header-y".
    
    Unfortunately, the patch program deletes the empty file when applying a kernel
    patch.
    
    It's not clear why this file is part of the UAPI at all.  Looking in:
    
            /usr/include/linux/irqnr.h
    
    there's nothing there but a header reinclusion guard and a comment.
    
    So just stick a comment in there as a placeholder.
    
    Without this, if the kernel is fabricated from, say, a tarball and a patch, you
    can get this error when building x86_64 or usermode Linux (and probably
    others):
    
    include/linux/irqnr.h:4:30: fatal error: uapi/linux/irqnr.h: No such file or directory
