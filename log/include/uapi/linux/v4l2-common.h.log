    media: v4l2-common.h: put backwards compat defines under #ifndef __KERNEL__
    
    This ensures that they won't be used in kernel code.

commit e2be04c7f9958dde770eeb8b30e829ca969b37bb
Author: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 1 15:09:13 2017 +0100

    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with a license
    
    Many user space API headers have licensing information, which is either
    incomplete, badly formatted or just a shorthand for referring to the
    license under which the file is supposed to be.  This makes it hard for
    compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    Update these files with an SPDX license identifier.  The identifier was
    chosen based on the license information in the file.
    
    GPL/LGPL licensed headers get the matching GPL/LGPL SPDX license
    identifier with the added 'WITH Linux-syscall-note' exception, which is
    the officially assigned exception identifier for the kernel syscall
    exception:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    This exception makes it possible to include GPL headers into non GPL
    code, without confusing license compliance tools.
    
    Headers which have either explicit dual licensing or are just licensed
    under a non GPL license are updated with the corresponding SPDX
    identifier and the GPLv2 with syscall exception identifier.  The format
    is:
            ((GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR SPDX-ID-OF-OTHER-LICENSE)
    
    SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding shorthand, which can be
    used instead of the full boiler plate text.  The update does not remove
    existing license information as this has to be done on a case by case
    basis and the copyright holders might have to be consulted. This will
    happen in a separate step.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.

    [media] media: v4l: Dual license v4l2-common.h under GPL v2 and BSD licenses
    
    The v4l2-common.h user space header was split off from videodev2.h, but
    the dual licensing of the videodev2.h (as well as other V4L2 headers) was
    missed. Change the license of the v4l2-common.h from GNU GPL v2 to both
    GNU GPL v2 and BSD.

    [media] v4l2-common.h: remove __user annotation in struct v4l2_edid
    
    The edid array is copied to kernelspace by the v4l2 core, so drivers
    shouldn't see the __user annotation. This conforms to other structs like
    v4l2_ext_controls where the data pointed to is copied to from user to
    kernelspace.

    [media] v4l2-common: fix warning when used on userpace
    
    As reported by Linus, make headers_check is reporting:
       usr/include/linux/v4l2-common.h:72: found __[us]{8,16,32,64} type without #include <linux/types.h>
    
       which seems to have come in through commits 777f4f85b75f1 and
       254a47770163f.
    
    That happens because struct v4l2_edid should be visible by both
    subdev and V4L2 APIs. So, it was moved to v4l2-common.h.
    
    As Linus pointed, the proper fix is to just add an include for
    linux/types.h at v4l2-common.h.

    [media] v4l2: allow v4l2_subdev_edid to be used with video nodes
    
    Struct v4l2_subdev_edid and the VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G/S_EDID ioctls were
    specific for subdevices, but for hardware with a simple video pipeline
    you do not need/want to create subdevice nodes to just get/set the EDID.
    
    Move the v4l2_subdev_edid struct to v4l2-common.h and rename as
    v4l2_edid. Add the same ioctls to videodev2.h as well, thus allowing
    this API to be used with both video nodes and v4l-subdev nodes.
