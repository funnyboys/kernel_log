    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with no license
    
    Many user space API headers are missing licensing information, which
    makes it hard for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default are files without license information under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPLV2.  Marking them GPLV2 would exclude
    them from being included in non GPLV2 code, which is obviously not
    intended. The user space API headers fall under the syscall exception
    which is in the kernels COPYING file:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    otherwise syscall usage would not be possible.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with an SPDX
    license identifier.  The chosen identifier is 'GPL-2.0 WITH
    Linux-syscall-note' which is the officially assigned identifier for the
    Linux syscall exception.  SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.

commit 6812baabf24d5c299c13223366a23c269408f4d0

    smc: establish pnet table management
    
    Connection creation with SMC-R starts through an internal
    TCP-connection. The Ethernet interface for this TCP-connection is not
    restricted to the Ethernet interface of a RoCE device. Any existing
    Ethernet interface belonging to the same physical net can be used, as
    long as there is a defined relation between the Ethernet interface and
    some RoCE devices. This relation is defined with the help of an
    identification string called "Physical Net ID" or short "pnet ID".
    Information about defined pnet IDs and their related Ethernet
    interfaces and RoCE devices is stored in the SMC-R pnet table.
    
    A pnet table entry consists of the identifying pnet ID and the
    associated network and IB device.
    This patch adds pnet table configuration support using the
    generic netlink message interface referring to network and IB device
    by their names. Commands exist to add, delete, and display pnet table
    entries, and to flush or display the entire pnet table.
    
    There are cross-checks to verify whether the ethernet interfaces
    or infiniband devices really exist in the system. If either device
    is not available, the pnet ID entry is not created.
    Loss of network devices and IB devices is also monitored;
    a pnet ID entry is removed when an associated network or
    IB device is removed.
