    net: socket: implement 64-bit timestamps
    
    The 'timeval' and 'timespec' data structures used for socket timestamps
    are going to be redefined in user space based on 64-bit time_t in future
    versions of the C library to deal with the y2038 overflow problem,
    which breaks the ABI definition.
    
    Unlike many modern ioctl commands, SIOCGSTAMP and SIOCGSTAMPNS do not
    use the _IOR() macro to encode the size of the transferred data, so it
    remains ambiguous whether the application uses the old or new layout.
    
    The best workaround I could find is rather ugly: we redefine the command
    code based on the size of the respective data structure with a ternary
    operator. This lets it get evaluated as late as possible, hopefully after
    that structure is visible to the caller. We cannot use an #ifdef here,
    because inux/sockios.h might have been included before any libc header
    that could determine the size of time_t.
    
    The ioctl implementation now interprets the new command codes as always
    referring to the 64-bit structure on all architectures, while the old
    architecture specific command code still refers to the old architecture
    specific layout. The new command number is only used when they are
    actually different.

    License cleanup: add SPDX license identifier to uapi header files with no license
    
    Many user space API headers are missing licensing information, which
    makes it hard for compliance tools to determine the correct license.
    
    By default are files without license information under the default
    license of the kernel, which is GPLV2.  Marking them GPLV2 would exclude
    them from being included in non GPLV2 code, which is obviously not
    intended. The user space API headers fall under the syscall exception
    which is in the kernels COPYING file:
    
       NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
       services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
       of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
    
    otherwise syscall usage would not be possible.
    
    Update the files which contain no license information with an SPDX
    license identifier.  The chosen identifier is 'GPL-2.0 WITH
    Linux-syscall-note' which is the officially assigned identifier for the
    Linux syscall exception.  SPDX license identifiers are a legally binding
    shorthand, which can be used instead of the full boiler plate text.
    
    This patch is based on work done by Thomas Gleixner and Kate Stewart and
    Philippe Ombredanne.  See the previous patch in this series for the
    methodology of how this patch was researched.
