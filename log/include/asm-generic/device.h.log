    Driver Core: Add platform device arch data V3
    
    Allow architecture specific data in struct platform_device V3.
    
    With this patch struct pdev_archdata is added to struct
    platform_device, similar to struct dev_archdata in found in
    struct device. Useful for architecture code that needs to
    keep extra data associated with each platform device.
    
    Struct pdev_archdata is different from dev.platform_data, the
    convention is that dev.platform_data points to driver-specific
    data. It may or may not be required by the driver. The format
    of this depends on driver but is the same across architectures.
    
    The structure pdev_archdata is a place for architecture specific
    data. This data is handled by architecture specific code (for
    example runtime PM), and since it is architecture specific it
    should _never_ be touched by device driver code. Exactly like
    struct dev_archdata but for platform devices.
    
    [rjw: This change is for power management mostly and that's why it
     goes through the suspend tree.]

    Driver core: add dev_archdata to struct device
    
    Add arch specific dev_archdata to struct device
    
    Adds an arch specific struct dev_arch to struct device. This enables
    architecture to add specific fields to every device in the system, like
    DMA operation pointers, NUMA node ID, firmware specific data, etc...
