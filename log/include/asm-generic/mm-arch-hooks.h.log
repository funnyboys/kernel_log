    mm: clean up per architecture MM hook header files
    
    Commit 2ae416b142b6 ("mm: new mm hook framework") introduced an empty
    header file (mm-arch-hooks.h) for every architecture, even those which
    doesn't need to define mm hooks.
    
    As suggested by Geert Uytterhoeven, this could be cleaned through the use
    of a generic header file included via each per architecture
    asm/include/Kbuild file.
    
    The PowerPC architecture is not impacted here since this architecture has
    to defined the arch_remap MM hook.
