    asm-generic: add generic versions of common headers
    
    These are all kernel internal interfaces that get copied
    around a lot. In most cases, architectures can provide
    their own optimized versions, but these generic versions
    can work as well.
    
    I have tried to use the most common contents of each
    header to allow existing architectures to migrate easily.
    
    Thanks to Remis for suggesting a number of cleanups.
