    ACPICA: EFI/EDK2: Sort acpi.h inclusion order
    
    ACPICA commit 43ff22215f0fcd8ca80abec5712a07d2cc9a801d
    
    acpi.h inclusion order need to be changed to build EDK-II ports of
    acpidump on Windows as va_list is used before it's definition in that
    environment. As we only need to ensure order of acenv.h/acenvex.h to
    be pre/post ACPICA type definitions, inclusion order is changed to make
    MSVC builds happy. Lv Zheng.

commit d13bd5a602982cd7f697e39b13ac736c2c553af1
Author: Lv Zheng <lv.zheng@intel.com>
Date:   Mon May 12 15:46:32 2014 +0800

    ACPICA: Linux headers: Add <acpi/platform/aclinuxex.h>
    
    From ACPICA's perspective, <acpi/actypes.h> should be included after
    inclusion of <acpi/platform/acenv.h>.  But currently in Linux,
    <acpi/platform/aclinux.h> included by <acpi/platform/acenv.h> has
    included <acpi/actypes.h> to find ACPICA types for inline functions.
    
    This causes the following problem:
    1. Redundant code in <asm/acpi.h> and <acpi/platform/aclinux.h>:
       Linux must be careful to keep conditions for <acpi/actypes.h> inclusion
       consistent with the conditions for <acpi/platform/aclinux.h> inclusion.
       Which finally leads to the issue that we have to keep many useless macro
       definitions in <acpi/platform/aclinux.h> or <asm/acpi.h>.
       Such conditions include:
         COMPILER_DEPENDENT_UINT64
         COMPILER_DEPENDENT_INT64
         ACPI_INLINE
         ACPI_SYSTEM_XFACE
         ACPI_EXTERNAL_XFACE
         ACPI_INTERNAL_XFACE
         ACPI_INTERNAL_VAR_XFACE
         ACPI_MUTEX_TYPE
         DEBUGGER_THREADING
         ACPI_ACQUIRE_GLOBAL_LOCK
         ACPI_RELEASE_GLOBAL_LOCK
         ACPI_FLUSH_CPU_CACHE
       They have default implementations in <include/acpi/platform/acenv.h>
       while Linux need to keep a copy in <asm/acpi.h> to avoid build errors.
    
    This patch introduces <acpi/platform/aclinuxex.h> to fix this issue by
    splitting conditions and declarations (most of them are inline functions)
    into 2 header files so that the wrong inclusion of <acpi/actypes.h> can be
    removed from <acpi/platform/aclinux.h>.
    
    This patch also removes old ACPI_NATIVE_INTERFACE_HEADER mechanism which is
    not preferred by Linux and adds the platform/acenvex.h to be the solution
    to solve this issue.

Author: Lv Zheng <lv.zheng@intel.com>
Date:   Sat Feb 8 09:42:53 2014 +0800

    ACPICA: Add support for extra, optional OS-specific header file.
    
    If OSPMs have something should appear after actypes.h to reference type
    definitions, the platform/acxxx.h is not sufficient as it is included by
    platform/acenv.h before including actypes.h.
    
    This patch introduces an OSPMs declarable headers to allow OSPMs to handle
    such requirement for their own purposes.
    
    This kind of header can also be used by Linux to collect the divergences
    that haven't been back ported yet.  Lv Zheng.

commit a8357b0c95484b46944728712f8810d3b37bf588
Author: Bob Moore <robert.moore@intel.com>
Date:   Fri Jan 22 19:07:36 2010 +0800

    ACPICA: Update all ACPICA copyrights and signons to 2010
    
    Add 2010 copyright to all module headers and signons, including
    the Linux header. This affects virtually every file in the ACPICA
    core subsystem, iASL compiler, and all utilities.

commit 50df4d8b0f6e1971b930f3158c9ee0e4263e636d
Author: Bob Moore <robert.moore@intel.com>
Date:   Wed Dec 31 03:01:23 2008 +0800

    ACPICA: Restructure includes into public/private
    
    acpi.h now includes only the "public" acpica headers. All other
    acpica headers are "private" and should not be included by acpica
    users. One new file, accommon.h is used to include the commonly
    used private headers for acpica code generation. Future plans
    are to move all private headers to a new subdirectory.

commit 4a90c7e86202f46fa9af011bdbcdf36e355d1721
Author: Bob Moore <robert.moore@intel.com>
Date:   Fri Jan 13 16:22:00 2006 -0500

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20060113
    
    Added 2006 copyright.
    
    At SuSE's suggestion, enabled all error messages
    without enabling function tracing, ie with CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG=n
    
    Replaced all instances of the ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT macro invoked at
    the ACPI_DB_ERROR and ACPI_DB_WARN debug levels with
    the ACPI_REPORT_ERROR and ACPI_REPORT_WARNING macros,
    respectively. This preserves all error and warning messages
    in the non-debug version of the ACPICA code (this has been
    referred to as the "debug lite" option.) Over 200 cases
    were converted to create a total of over 380 error/warning
    messages across the ACPICA code. This increases the code
    and data size of the default non-debug version by about 13K.
    Added ACPI_NO_ERROR_MESSAGES flag to enable deleting all messages.
    The size of the debug version remains about the same.

commit 44f6c01242da4e162f28d8e1216a8c7a91174605
Author: Robert Moore <robert.moore@intel.com>
Date:   Mon Apr 18 22:49:35 2005 -0400

    ACPICA 20050408 from Bob Moore
    
    Fixed three cases in the interpreter where an "index"
    argument to an ASL function was still (internally) 32
    bits instead of the required 64 bits.  This was the Index
    argument to the Index, Mid, and Match operators.
    
    The "strupr" function is now permanently local
    (acpi_ut_strupr), since this is not a POSIX-defined
    function and not present in most kernel-level C
    libraries. References to the C library strupr function
    have been removed from the headers.
    
    Completed the deployment of static
    functions/prototypes. All prototypes with the static
    attribute have been moved from the headers to the owning
    C file.
    
    ACPICA 20050329 from Bob Moore
    
    An error is now generated if an attempt is made to create
    a Buffer Field of length zero (A CreateField with a length
    operand of zero.)
    
    The interpreter now issues a warning whenever executable
    code at the module level is detected during ACPI table
    load. This will give some idea of the prevalence of this
    type of code.
    
    Implemented support for references to named objects (other
    than control methods) within package objects.
    
    Enhanced package object output for the debug
    object. Package objects are now completely dumped, showing
    all elements.
    
    Enhanced miscellaneous object output for the debug
    object. Any object can now be written to the debug object
    (for example, a device object can be written, and the type
    of the object will be displayed.)
    
    The "static" qualifier has been added to all local
    functions across the core subsystem.
    
    The number of "long" lines (> 80 chars) within the source
    has been significantly reduced, by about 1/3.
    
    Cleaned up all header files to ensure that all CA/iASL
    functions are prototyped (even static functions) and the
    formatting is consistent.
    
    Two new header files have been added, acopcode.h and
    acnames.h.
    
    Removed several obsolete functions that were no longer
    used.

commit 1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org>
Date:   Sat Apr 16 15:20:36 2005 -0700

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
