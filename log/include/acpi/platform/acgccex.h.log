    ACPICA: OSL: Fix a regression that old GCC requires a workaround for strchr()
    
    ACPICA commit be836c36454a624a4fb1d17234080ef8c07993fc
    
    There is a GCC false-warning issue on specific GCC versions that
    "strchr" will be preprocessed and extracted to contain
    !__buildin_constant_p() checker and it surely is a constant logical
    value "1" for strchr() arguments. Then -Wlogical-op errorneously reports a
    warning.
    
    The regression is triggered after the standard headers are re-ordered in
    the EFI porting task. This patch fixes this regression by moving the
    workaround to a new position after including all other standard headers.
