    ACPICA: OSL: Add support to exclude stdarg.h
    
    ACPICA commit e2df7455a9a4301b03668e4c9c02c7a564cc841c
    
    Some hosts may choose not to include stdarg.h, implementing a
    configurability in acgcc.h, allowing OSen like Solaris to exclude stdarg.h.
    This patch also fixes acintel.h accordingly without providing builtin
    support as Intel compiler is similar as GCC. Reported by Dana Myers, fixed
    by Lv Zheng.

    ACPICA: Linuxize: Restore and fix Intel compiler build
    
    ACPICA commit b59347d0b8b676cb555fe8da5cad08fcd4eeb0d3
    
    The following commit cleans up compiler specific inclusions:
    
      Commit: 9fa1cebdbfff3db8953cebca8ee327d75edefc40
      Subject: ACPICA: OSL: Cleanup the inclusion order of the compiler-specific headers
    
    But breaks one thing due to the following old issue:
    
     Buidling Linux kernel with Intel compiler originally depends on acgcc.h
     not acintel.h.
    
    So after making Intel compiler build working in ACPICA upstream by
    correctly using acintel.h, it becomes unable to build Linux kernel using
    Intel compiler as there is no acintel.h in the kernel source tree.
    
    This patch releases acintel.h to Linux kernel and fixes its inclusion in
    acenv.h.
    
    Fixes: 9fa1cebdbfff (ACPICA: OSL: Cleanup the inclusion order of the compiler-specific headers)
