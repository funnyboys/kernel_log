commit 164a08cee1358e360c47fcb26a7720461d5853a5
Author: Lv Zheng <lv.zheng@intel.com>

    ACPICA: Dispatcher: Introduce timeout mechanism for infinite loop detection
    
    ACPICA commit 9605023e7e6d1f05581502766c8cf2905bcc03d9
    
    This patch implements a new infinite loop detection mechanism to replace
    the old one, it uses acpi_os_get_timer() to limit loop execution into a
    determined time slice.
    This is useful in case some hardware/firmware operations really require the
    AML interpreter to wait while the old mechanism could expire too fast on
    recent machines.
    
    The new mechanism converts old acpi_gbl_max_loop_iterations to store the user
    configurable value for the new mechanism in order to allow users to be
    still able to configure this value for acpiexec via command line. This
    patch also removes wrong initilization code of acpi_gbl_max_loop_iterations
    accordingly (it should have been initialized by ACPI_INIT_GLOBAL, and the
    default value is also properly tuned for acpiexec). Reported by M. Foronda,
    fixed by Lv Zheng.

    ACPICA: iasl: add ASL conversion tool
    
    ACPICA commit c04d310039d3e0ed1cb62876fe7e596fbc75ab01
    ACPICA commit a65c1df7e6b4bad8e37df822018c40c6c446add9
    
    The key feature of this utility is that the original comments within
    the input ASL files are preserved during the conversion process, and
    included within the converted ASL+ file -- thus creating a transparent
    conversion of existing ASL files to ASL+ (ASL 2.0)
    
    This patch is an automatic generation of the ASL converter commit,
    Linux kernel isn't affected by the functionality provided in this
    commit, but requires the linuxized changes to support future ACPICA
    release automation.

commit 90da690bc488bdc6333fe7565e6ab8daa5540327
Author: Bob Moore <robert.moore@intel.com>
Date:   Wed Jul 30 12:20:39 2014 +0800

    ACPICA: Disassembler: Add support for the ToUUID opererator (macro).
    
    This change adds support to disassemble a UUID back to the original
    ToUUID operator. It will detect a UUID within a standard AML Buffer.
    Also, a description of the UUID is emitted for "known" UUIDs, defined
    as UUIDs that are defined in the ACPI specification.
    
    Since this is a change for disassembler which is not shipped in the
    Linux kernel, the Linux kernel is not affected.

    ACPICA: Headers: Deploy #pragma pack (push) and (pop).
    
    Use push and pop to both guarantee that the correct alignment is used,
    and to restore the alignment to whatever it was before the header
    was included.
    
    It is reported that the #pragma pack(push/pop) directives are not supported
    by the specific GCCs, but this patch still doesn't affect kernel build
    as there are already #pragma pack([1]) directives used in the old ACPICA
    headers, which means there shouldn't be GCCs that are currently used to
    compile the ACPI kernels do not support #pragma pack() directives.

    ACPICA: Restructure includes into public/private
    
    acpi.h now includes only the "public" acpica headers. All other
    acpica headers are "private" and should not be included by acpica
    users. One new file, accommon.h is used to include the commonly
    used private headers for acpica code generation. Future plans
    are to move all private headers to a new subdirectory.

  * OS name, used for the _OS object.  The _OS object is essentially obsolete,

commit fc37445733aeae4fd1a20385850620354263b1d5
Author: Bob Moore <robert.moore@intel.com>
Date:   Wed Nov 12 15:15:29 2008 +0800

    ACPICA: Add a mechanism to escape infinite AML While() loops
    
    Add a loop counter to force exit from AML While loops if the
    count becomes too large. This can occur in poorly written AML
    when the hardware does not respond within a while loop and the
    loop does not implement a timeout. The maximum loop count is
    configurable. A new exception code is returned when a loop is
    broken, AE_AML_INFINITE_LOOP.  Bob Moore, Alexey Starikovskiy.

    ACPICA: Implement simplified Table Manager
    
    The Table Manager component has been completely
    redesigned and reimplemented. The new design is much
    simpler, and reduces the overall code and data size of
    the kernel-resident ACPICA by approximately 5%. Also,
    it is now possible to obtain the ACPI tables very early
    during kernel initialization, even before dynamic memory
    management is initialized.

    ACPI: increase ACPI_MAX_REFERENCE_COUNT for larger systems
    
    We have some new larger ia64 systems in HP that trip over the
    ACPI_MAX_REFERENCE_COUNT limit which triggers a large number of these
    debug messages:
    
    ACPI Warning (utdelete-0397): Large Reference Count (XXX) in object e0000a0ff6797ab0  [20060707]
    
    This was increased once in the past as described in this very brief thread:

    ACPI: ACPICA 20060707
    
    Added the ACPI_PACKED_POINTERS_NOT_SUPPORTED macro to
    support C compilers that do not allow the initialization
    of address pointers within packed structures - even though
    the hardware itself may support misaligned transfers. Some
    of the debug data structures are packed by default to
    minimize size.
    
    Added an error message for the case where
    acpi_os_get_thread_id() returns zero. A non-zero value is
    required by the core ACPICA code to ensure the proper
    operation of AML mutexes and recursive control methods.
    
    The DSDT is now the only ACPI table that determines whether
    the AML interpreter is in 32-bit or 64-bit mode. Not really
    a functional change, but the hooks for per-table 32/64
    switching have been removed from the code. A clarification
    to the ACPI specification is forthcoming in ACPI 3.0B.
    
    Fixed a possible leak of an Owner ID in the error
    path of tbinstal.c acpi_tb_init_table_descriptor() and
    migrated all table OwnerID deletion to a single place in
    acpi_tb_uninstall_table() to correct possible leaks when using
    the acpi_tb_delete_tables_by_type() interface (with assistance
    from Lance Ortiz.)
    
    Fixed a problem with Serialized control methods where the
    semaphore associated with the method could be over-signaled
    after multiple method invocations.
    
    Fixed two issues with the locking of the internal
    namespace data structure. Both the Unload() operator and
    acpi_unload_table() interface now lock the namespace during
    the namespace deletion associated with the table unload
    (with assistance from Linn Crosetto.)

  * OS name, used for the _OS object.  The _OS object is essentially obsolete,

commit 967440e3be1af06ad4dc7bb18d2e3c16130fe067
Author: Bob Moore <robert.moore@intel.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 23 17:04:00 2006 -0400

    ACPI: ACPICA 20060623
    
    Implemented a new acpi_spinlock type for the OSL lock
    interfaces.  This allows the type to be customized to
    the host OS for improved efficiency (since a spinlock is
    usually a very small object.)
    
    Implemented support for "ignored" bits in the ACPI
    registers.  According to the ACPI specification, these
    bits should be preserved when writing the registers via
    a read/modify/write cycle. There are 3 bits preserved
    in this manner: PM1_CONTROL[0] (SCI_EN), PM1_CONTROL[9],
    and PM1_STATUS[11].
    http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3691
    
    Implemented the initial deployment of new OSL mutex
    interfaces.  Since some host operating systems have
    separate mutex and semaphore objects, this feature was
    requested. The base code now uses mutexes (and the new
    mutex interfaces) wherever a binary semaphore was used
    previously. However, for the current release, the mutex
    interfaces are defined as macros to map them to the
    existing semaphore interfaces.
    
    Fixed several problems with the support for the control
    method SyncLevel parameter. The SyncLevel now works
    according to the ACPI specification and in concert with the
    Mutex SyncLevel parameter, since the current SyncLevel is
    a property of the executing thread. Mutual exclusion for
    control methods is now implemented with a mutex instead
    of a semaphore.
    
    Fixed three instances of the use of the C shift operator
    in the bitfield support code (exfldio.c) to avoid the use
    of a shift value larger than the target data width. The
    behavior of C compilers is undefined in this case and can
    cause unpredictable results, and therefore the case must
    be detected and avoided.  (Fiodor Suietov)
    
    Added an info message whenever an SSDT or OEM table
    is loaded dynamically via the Load() or LoadTable()
    ASL operators. This should improve debugging capability
    since it will show exactly what tables have been loaded
    (beyond the tables present in the RSDT/XSDT.)

    ACPI: ACPICA 20060608
    
    Converted the locking mutex used for the ACPI hardware
    to a spinlock. This change should eliminate all problems
    caused by attempting to acquire a semaphore at interrupt
    level, and it means that all ACPICA external interfaces
    that directly access the ACPI hardware can be safely
    called from interrupt level.
    
    Fixed a regression introduced in 20060526 where the ACPI
    device initialization could be prematurely aborted with
    an AE_NOT_FOUND if a device did not have an optional
    _INI method.
    
    Fixed an IndexField issue where a write to the Data
    Register should be limited in size to the AccessSize
    (width) of the IndexField itself. (BZ 433, Fiodor Suietov)
    
    Fixed problem reports (Valery Podrezov) integrated: - Allow

    correctly (BZ 364)
    
    Removed four global mutexes that were obsolete and were

    ACPI: ACPICA 20060526
    
    Restructured, flattened, and simplified the internal
    interfaces for namespace object evaluation - resulting
    in smaller code, less CPU stack use, and fewer
    interfaces. (With assistance from Mikhail Kouzmich)
    
    Fixed a problem with the CopyObject operator where the
    first parameter was not typed correctly for the parser,
    interpreter, compiler, and disassembler. Caused various
    errors and unexpected behavior.
    
    Fixed a problem where a ShiftLeft or ShiftRight of
    more than 64 bits produced incorrect results with some
    C compilers. Since the behavior of C compilers when
    the shift value is larger than the datatype width is
    apparently not well defined, the interpreter now detects
    this condition and simply returns zero as expected in all
    such cases. (BZ 395)
    
    Fixed problem reports (Valery Podrezov) integrated: -
    Update String-to-Integer conversion to match ACPI 3.0A spec
    http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5329
    Allow interpreter to handle nested method declarations
    http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5361
    
    Fixed problem reports (Fiodor Suietov) integrated: -
    acpi_terminate() doesn't free debug memory allocation
    list objects (BZ 355) - After Core Subsystem
    shutdown, acpi_subsystem_status() returns AE_OK (BZ 356) -
    acpi_os_unmap_memory() for RSDP can be invoked inconsistently
    (BZ 357) - Resource Manager should return AE_TYPE for
    non-device objects (BZ 358) - Incomplete cleanup branch
    in AcpiNsEvaluateRelative (BZ 359) - Use acpi_os_free()
    instead of ACPI_FREE in acpi_rs_set_srs_method_data (BZ 360)
    - Incomplete cleanup branch in acpi_ps_parse_aml (BZ 361) -
    Incomplete cleanup branch in acpi_ds_delete_walk_state (BZ 362)
    - acpi_get_table_header returns AE_NO_ACPI_TABLES until DSDT
    is loaded (BZ 365) - Status of the Global Initialization
    Handler call not used (BZ 366) - Incorrect object parameter
    to Global Initialization Handler (BZ 367)

commit 958dd242b691f64ab4632b4903dbb1e16fee8269
Author: Bob Moore <robert.moore@intel.com>
Date:   Fri May 12 17:12:00 2006 -0400

    ACPI: ACPICA 20060512
    
    Replaced the acpi_os_queue_for_execution() with a new
    interface named acpi_os_execute(). The major difference is
    that the new interface does not have a Priority parameter,
    this appeared to be useless and has been replaced by
    a Type parameter. The Type tells the OS what type of
    execution is being requested, such as global lock handler,
    notify handler, GPE handler, etc. This allows the host
    to queue and execute the request as appropriate for the
    request type, possibly using different work queues and
    different priorities for the various request types. This
    enables fixes for multithreading deadlock problems such as
    http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5534
    (Alexey Starikovskiy and Bob Moore)
    
    Fixed a possible memory leak associated with the
    support for the so-called "implicit return" ACPI
    extension. Reported by FreeBSD  (Fiodor Suietov)
    http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6514
    
    Fixed a problem with the Load() operator where a table
    load from an operation region could overwrite an internal
    table buffer by up to 7 bytes and cause alignment faults
    on IPF systems. (With assistance from Luming Yu)

commit b229cf92eee616c7cb5ad8cdb35a19b119f00bc8
Author: Bob Moore <robert.moore@intel.com>
Date:   Fri Apr 21 17:15:00 2006 -0400

    ACPI: ACPICA 20060421
    
    Removed a device initialization optimization introduced in
    20051216 where the _STA method was not run unless an _INI
    was also present for the same device. This optimization
    could cause problems because it could allow _INI methods
    to be run within a not-present device subtree (If a
    not-present device had no _INI, _STA would not be run,
    the not-present status would not be discovered, and the
    children of the device would be incorrectly traversed.)
    
    Implemented a new _STA optimization where namespace
    subtrees that do not contain _INI are identified and
    ignored during device initialization. Selectively running
    _STA can significantly improve boot time on large machines
    (with assistance from Len Brown.)
    
    Implemented support for the device initialization case
    where the returned _STA flags indicate a device not-present
    but functioning. In this case, _INI is not run, but the
    device children are examined for presence, as per the
    ACPI specification.
    
    Implemented an additional change to the IndexField support
    in order to conform to MS behavior. The value written to
    the Index Register is not simply a byte offset, it is a
    byte offset in units of the access width of the parent
    Index Field. (Fiodor Suietov)
    
    Defined and deployed a new OSL interface,
    acpi_os_validate_address().  This interface is called during
    the creation of all AML operation regions, and allows
    the host OS to exert control over what addresses it will
    allow the AML code to access. Operation Regions whose
    addresses are disallowed will cause a runtime exception
    when they are actually accessed (will not affect or abort
    table loading.)
    
    Defined and deployed a new OSL interface,
    acpi_os_validate_interface().  This interface allows the host OS
    to match the various "optional" interface/behavior strings
    for the _OSI predefined control method as appropriate
    (with assistance from Bjorn Helgaas.)
    
    Restructured and corrected various problems in the
    exception handling code paths within DsCallControlMethod
    and DsTerminateControlMethod in dsmethod (with assistance
    from Takayoshi Kochi.)
    
    Modified the Linux source converter to ignore quoted string
    literals while converting identifiers from mixed to lower
    case. This will correct problems with the disassembler
    and other areas where such strings must not be modified.
    
    The ACPI_FUNCTION_* macros no longer require quotes around
    the function name. This allows the Linux source converter
    to convert the names, now that the converter ignores
    quoted strings.

commit 793c2388cae3fd023b3b5166354931752d42353c
Author: Bob Moore <robert.moore@intel.com>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 00:00:00 2006 -0500

    ACPI: ACPICA 20060331
    
    Implemented header file support for the following
    additional ACPI tables: ASF!, BOOT, CPEP, DBGP, MCFG, SPCR,
    SPMI, TCPA, and WDRT. With this support, all current and
    known ACPI tables are now defined in the ACPICA headers and
    are available for use by device drivers and other software.
    
    Implemented support to allow tables that contain ACPI
    names with invalid characters to be loaded. Previously,
    this would cause the table load to fail, but since
    there are several known cases of such tables on
    existing machines, this change was made to enable
    ACPI support for them. Also, this matches the
    behavior of the Microsoft ACPI implementation.
    https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=147621
    
    Fixed a couple regressions introduced during the memory
    optimization in the 20060317 release. The namespace
    node definition required additional reorganization and
    an internal datatype that had been changed to 8-bit was
    restored to 32-bit. (Valery Podrezov)
    
    Fixed a problem where a null pointer passed to
    acpi_ut_delete_generic_state() could be passed through
    to acpi_os_release_object which is unexpected. Such
    null pointers are now trapped and ignored, matching
    the behavior of the previous implementation before the
    deployment of acpi_os_release_object().  (Valery Podrezov,
    Fiodor Suietov)
    
    Fixed a memory mapping leak during the deletion of
    a SystemMemory operation region where a cached memory
    mapping was not deleted. This became a noticeable problem
    for operation regions that are defined within frequently
    used control methods. (Dana Meyers)
    
    Reorganized the ACPI table header files into two main
    files: one for the ACPI tables consumed by the ACPICA core,
    and another for the miscellaneous ACPI tables that are
    consumed by the drivers and other software. The various
    FADT definitions were merged into one common section and
    three different tables (ACPI 1.0, 1.0+, and 2.0)

Date:   Fri Mar 17 16:44:00 2006 -0500

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20060317
    
    Implemented the use of a cache object for all internal
    namespace nodes. Since there are about 1000 static nodes
    in a typical system, this will decrease memory use for
    cache implementations that minimize per-allocation overhead
    (such as a slab allocator.)
    
    Removed the reference count mechanism for internal
    namespace nodes, since it was deemed unnecessary. This
    reduces the size of each namespace node by about 5%-10%
    on all platforms. Nodes are now 20 bytes for the 32-bit
    case, and 32 bytes for the 64-bit case.
    
    Optimized several internal data structures to reduce
    object size on 64-bit platforms by packing data within
    the 64-bit alignment. This includes the frequently used
    ACPI_OPERAND_OBJECT, of which there can be ~1000 static
    instances corresponding to the namespace objects.
    
    Added two new strings for the predefined _OSI method:
    "Windows 2001.1 SP1" and "Windows 2006".
    
    Split the allocation tracking mechanism out to a separate
    file, from utalloc.c to uttrack.c. This mechanism appears
    to be only useful for application-level code. Kernels may
    wish to not include uttrack.c in distributions.
    
    Removed all remnants of the obsolete ACPI_REPORT_* macros
    and the associated code. (These macros have been replaced
    by the ACPI_ERROR and ACPI_WARNING macros.)

    Tagged all external interfaces to the subsystem with the
    new ACPI_EXPORT_SYMBOL macro. This macro can be defined
    as necessary to assist kernel integration. For Linux,
    the macro resolves to the EXPORT_SYMBOL macro. The default
    definition is NULL.
    
    Added the ACPI_THREAD_ID type for the return value from
    acpi_os_get_thread_id(). This allows the host to define this
    as necessary to simplify kernel integration. The default
    definition is ACPI_NATIVE_UINT.
    
    Valery Podrezov fixed two interpreter problems related
    to error processing, the deletion of objects, and placing
    invalid pointers onto the internal operator result stack.
    http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6028
    http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6151
    
    Increased the reference count threshold where a warning is
    emitted for large reference counts in order to eliminate
    unnecessary warnings on systems with large namespaces
    (especially 64-bit.) Increased the value from 0x400
    to 0x800.
    
    Due to universal disagreement as to the meaning of the
    'c' in the calloc() function, the ACPI_MEM_CALLOCATE
    macro has been renamed to ACPI_ALLOCATE_ZEROED so that the
    purpose of the interface is 'clear'. ACPI_MEM_ALLOCATE and
    ACPI_MEM_FREE are renamed to ACPI_ALLOCATE and ACPI_FREE.

    Implemented a change to the IndexField support to match
    the behavior of the Microsoft AML interpreter. The value
    written to the Index register is now a byte offset,
    no longer an index based upon the width of the Data
    register. This should fix IndexField problems seen on
    some machines where the Data register is not exactly one
    byte wide. The ACPI specification will be clarified on
    this point.
    
    Fixed a problem where several resource descriptor
    types could overrun the internal descriptor buffer due
    to size miscalculation: VendorShort, VendorLong, and
    Interrupt. This was noticed on IA64 machines, but could
    affect all platforms.
    
    Fixed a problem where individual resource descriptors were

commit b8e4d89357fc434618a59c1047cac72641191805
Author: Bob Moore <robert.moore@intel.com>

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20060127
    
    Implemented support in the Resource Manager to allow
    unresolved namestring references within resource package
    objects for the _PRT method. This support is in addition
    to the previously implemented unresolved reference
    support within the AML parser. If the interpreter slack
    mode is enabled (true on Linux unless acpi=strict),
    these unresolved references will be passed through
    to the caller as a NULL package entry.
    http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5741
    
    Implemented and deployed new macros and functions for
    error and warning messages across the subsystem. These
    macros are simpler and generate less code than their
    predecessors. The new macros ACPI_ERROR, ACPI_EXCEPTION,
    ACPI_WARNING, and ACPI_INFO replace the ACPI_REPORT_*
    macros.
    
    Implemented the acpi_cpu_flags type to simplify host OS
    integration of the Acquire/Release Lock OSL interfaces.
    Suggested by Steven Rostedt and Andrew Morton.
    
    Fixed a problem where Alias ASL operators are sometimes
    not correctly resolved. causing AE_AML_INTERNAL
    http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5189
    http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5674
    
    Fixed several problems with the implementation of the
    ConcatenateResTemplate ASL operator. As per the ACPI
    specification, zero length buffers are now treated as a
    single EndTag. One-length buffers always cause a fatal
    exception. Non-zero length buffers that do not end with
    a full 2-byte EndTag cause a fatal exception.
    
    Fixed a possible structure overwrite in the
    AcpiGetObjectInfo external interface. (With assistance
    from Thomas Renninger)

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20060113
    
    Added 2006 copyright.
    
    At SuSE's suggestion, enabled all error messages
    without enabling function tracing, ie with CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG=n
    
    Replaced all instances of the ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT macro invoked at
    the ACPI_DB_ERROR and ACPI_DB_WARN debug levels with
    the ACPI_REPORT_ERROR and ACPI_REPORT_WARNING macros,
    respectively. This preserves all error and warning messages
    in the non-debug version of the ACPICA code (this has been
    referred to as the "debug lite" option.) Over 200 cases
    were converted to create a total of over 380 error/warning
    messages across the ACPICA code. This increases the code
    and data size of the default non-debug version by about 13K.
    Added ACPI_NO_ERROR_MESSAGES flag to enable deleting all messages.
    The size of the debug version remains about the same.

commit defba1d8f233c0d5cf3e1ea6aeb898eca7231860

Date:   Fri Dec 16 17:05:00 2005 -0500

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20051216
    
    Implemented optional support to allow unresolved names
    within ASL Package objects. A null object is inserted in
    the package when a named reference cannot be located in
    the current namespace. Enabled via the interpreter slack
    flag which Linux has enabled by default (acpi=strict
    to disable slack).  This should eliminate AE_NOT_FOUND
    exceptions seen on machines that contain such code.
    
    Implemented an optimization to the initialization
    sequence that can improve boot time. During ACPI device
    initialization, the _STA method is now run if and only
    if the _INI method exists. The _STA method is used to
    determine if the device is present; An _INI can only be
    run if _STA returns present, but it is a waste of time to
    run the _STA method if the _INI does not exist. (Prototype
    and assistance from Dong Wei)
    
    Implemented use of the C99 uintptr_t for the pointer
    casting macros if it is available in the current
    compiler. Otherwise, the default (void *) cast is used
    as before.
    
    Fixed some possible memory leaks found within the
    execution path of the Break, Continue, If, and CreateField
    operators. (Valery Podrezov)
    
    Fixed a problem introduced in the 20051202 release where
    an exception is generated during method execution if a
    control method attempts to declare another method.

    Modified the parsing of control methods to no longer
    create namespace objects during the first pass of the
    parse. Objects are now created only during the execute
    phase, at the moment the namespace creation operator
    is encountered in the AML (Name, OperationRegion,
    CreateByteField, etc.) This should eliminate ALREADY_EXISTS
    exceptions seen on some machines where reentrant control
    methods are protected by an AML mutex. The mutex will now
    correctly block multiple threads from attempting to create
    the same object more than once.
    
    Increased the number of available Owner Ids for namespace
    object tracking from 32 to 255. This should eliminate the
    OWNER_ID_LIMIT exceptions seen on some machines with a
    large number of ACPI tables (either static or dynamic).
    
    Enhanced the namespace dump routine to output the owner
    ID for each namespace object.

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20051117
    
    Fixed a problem in the AML parser where the method thread
    count could be decremented below zero if any errors
    occurred during the method parse phase. This should
    eliminate AE_AML_METHOD_LIMIT exceptions seen on some
    machines. This also fixed a related regression with the
    mechanism that detects and corrects methods that cannot
    properly handle reentrancy (related to the deployment of
    the new OwnerId mechanism.)
    
    Eliminated the pre-parsing of control methods (to detect
    errors) during table load. Related to the problem above,
    this was causing unwind issues if any errors occurred
    during the parse, and it seemed to be overkill. A table
    load should not be aborted if there are problems with
    any single control method, thus rendering this feature
    rather pointless.
    
    Fixed a problem with the new table-driven resource manager
    where an internal buffer overflow could occur for small
    resource templates.
    
    Implemented a new external interface, acpi_get_vendor_resource()
    This interface will find and return a vendor-defined
    resource descriptor within a _CRS or _PRS
    method via an ACPI 3.0 UUID match. (from Bjorn Helgaas)
    
    Removed the length limit (200) on string objects as
    per the upcoming ACPI 3.0A specification. This affects
    the following areas of the interpreter: 1) any implicit
    conversion of a Buffer to a String, 2) a String object
    result of the ASL Concatentate operator, 3) the String
    object result of the ASL ToString operator.

    Modified the subsystem initialization sequence to improve
    GPE support. The GPE initialization has been split into
    two parts in order to defer execution of the _PRW methods
    (Power Resources for Wake) until after the hardware is
    fully initialized and the SCI handler is installed. This
    allows the _PRW methods to access fields protected by the
    Global Lock. This will fix systems where a NO_GLOBAL_LOCK
    exception has been seen during initialization.
    
    Fixed a regression with the ConcatenateResTemplate()
    ASL operator introduced in the 20051021 release.
    
    Implemented support for "local" internal ACPI object
    types within the debugger "Object" command and the
    acpi_walk_namespace() external interfaces. These local
    types include RegionFields, BankFields, IndexFields, Alias,
    and reference objects.
    
    Moved common AML resource handling code into a new file,
    "utresrc.c". This code is shared by both the Resource
    Manager and the AML Debugger.

    Implemented support for the EM64T and other x86_64
    processors. This essentially entails recognizing
    that these processors support non-aligned memory
    transfers. Previously, all 64-bit processors were assumed
    to lack hardware support for non-aligned transfers.
    
    Completed conversion of the Resource Manager to nearly
    full table-driven operation. Specifically, the resource
    conversion code (convert AML to internal format and the
    reverse) and the debug code to dump internal resource
    descriptors are fully table-driven, reducing code and data
    size and improving maintainability.
    
    The OSL interfaces for Acquire and Release Lock now use a
    64-bit flag word on 64-bit processors instead of a fixed
    32-bit word. (Alexey Starikovskiy)
    
    Implemented support within the resource conversion code
    for the Type-Specific byte within the various ACPI 3.0
    *WordSpace macros.
    
    Fixed some issues within the resource conversion code for
    the type-specific flags for both Memory and I/O address
    resource descriptors. For Memory, implemented support
    for the MTP and TTP flags. For I/O, split the TRS and TTP
    flags into two separate fields.

Date:   Fri Sep 30 19:03:00 2005 -0400

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20050930
    
    Completed a major overhaul of the Resource Manager code -
    specifically, optimizations in the area of the AML/internal
    resource conversion code. The code has been optimized to
    simplify and eliminate duplicated code, CPU stack use has
    been decreased by optimizing function parameters and local
    variables, and naming conventions across the manager have
    been standardized for clarity and ease of maintenance (this
    includes function, parameter, variable, and struct/typedef
    names.)
    
    All Resource Manager dispatch and information tables have
    been moved to a single location for clarity and ease of
    maintenance. One new file was created, named "rsinfo.c".
    
    The ACPI return macros (return_ACPI_STATUS, etc.) have
    been modified to guarantee that the argument is
    not evaluated twice, making them less prone to macro
    side-effects. However, since there exists the possibility
    of additional stack use if a particular compiler cannot
    optimize them (such as in the debug generation case),
    the original macros are optionally available.  Note that
    some invocations of the return_VALUE macro may now cause
    size mismatch warnings; the return_UINT8 and return_UINT32
    macros are provided to eliminate these. (From Randy Dunlap)
    
    Implemented a new mechanism to enable debug tracing for
    individual control methods. A new external interface,
    acpi_debug_trace(), is provided to enable this mechanism. The
    intent is to allow the host OS to easily enable and disable
    tracing for problematic control methods. This interface
    can be easily exposed to a user or debugger interface if
    desired. See the file psxface.c for details.
    
    acpi_ut_callocate() will now return a valid pointer if a
    length of zero is specified - a length of one is used
    and a warning is issued. This matches the behavior of
    acpi_ut_allocate().

    large switch() statements.  This reduces overall subsystem
    code size and code complexity.  Affects the resource parsing
    and construction, disassembly, and debug dump output.

    Fixed a problem within the resource manager code where
    the transaction flags for a 64-bit address descriptor were
    handled incorrectly in the type-specific flag byte.
    
    Consolidated duplicate code within the address descriptor

    Implemented a full bytewise compare to determine if a table load
    request is attempting to load a duplicate table. The compare is
    performed if the table signatures and table lengths match. This
    will allow different tables with the same OEM Table ID and
    revision to be loaded.
    
    Although the BIOS is technically violating the ACPI spec when
    this happens -- it does happen -- so Linux must handle it.

Date:   Fri Jul 29 15:15:00 2005 -0700

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20050729 from Bob Moore
    
    Implemented support to ignore an attempt to install/load
    a particular ACPI table more than once. Apparently there
    exists BIOS code that repeatedly attempts to load the same
    SSDT upon certain events. Thanks to Venkatesh Pallipadi.
    
    Restructured the main interface to the AML parser in
    order to correctly handle all exceptional conditions. This
    will prevent leakage of the OwnerId resource and should
    eliminate the AE_OWNER_ID_LIMIT exceptions seen on some
    machines. Thanks to Alexey Starikovskiy.
    
    Support for "module level code" has been disabled in this
    version due to a number of issues that have appeared
    on various machines. The support can be enabled by
    defining ACPI_ENABLE_MODULE_LEVEL_CODE during subsystem
    compilation. When the issues are fully resolved, the code
    will be enabled by default again.
    
    Modified the internal functions for debug print support
    to define the FunctionName parameter as a (const char *)
    for compatibility with compiler built-in macros such as
    __FUNCTION__, etc.
    
    Linted the entire ACPICA source tree for both 32-bit
    and 64-bit.

    ACPICA 20050708 from Bob Moore <robert.moore@intel.com>
    
    The use of the CPU stack in the debug version of the
    subsystem has been considerably reduced.  Previously, a
    debug structure was declared in every function that used
    the debug macros.  This structure has been removed in
    favor of declaring the individual elements as parameters
    to the debug functions.  This reduces the cumulative stack
    use during nested execution of ACPI function calls at the
    cost of a small increase in the code size of the debug
    version of the subsystem.  With assistance from Alexey
    Starikovskiy and Len Brown.
    
    Added the ACPI_GET_FUNCTION_NAME macro to enable the
    compiler-dependent headers to define a macro that will
    return the current function name at runtime (such as
    __FUNCTION__ or _func_, etc.) The function name is used
    by the debug trace output.  If ACPI_GET_FUNCTION_NAME
    is not defined in the compiler-dependent header, the
    function name is saved on the CPU stack (one pointer per
    function.) This mechanism is used because apparently there
    exists no standard ANSI-C defined macro that that returns
    the function name.
    
    Alexey Starikovskiy redesigned and reimplemented the
    "Owner ID" mechanism used to track namespace objects
    created/deleted by ACPI tables and control method
    execution.  A bitmap is now used to allocate and free the
    IDs, thus solving the wraparound problem present in the
    previous implementation.  The size of the namespace node
    descriptor was reduced by 2 bytes as a result.
    
    Removed the UINT32_BIT and UINT16_BIT types that were used
    for the bitfield flag definitions within the headers for
    the predefined ACPI tables.  These have been replaced by
    UINT8_BIT in order to increase the code portability of
    the subsystem.  If the use of UINT8 remains a problem,
    we may be forced to eliminate bitfields entirely because
    of a lack of portability.
    
    Alexey Starikovksiy enhanced the performance of
    acpi_ut_update_object_reference.  This is a frequently used
    function and this improvement increases the performance
    of the entire subsystem.
    
    Alexey Starikovskiy fixed several possible memory leaks
    and the inverse - premature object deletion.

    ACPICA 20050617-0624 from Bob Moore <robert.moore@intel.com>
    
    ACPICA 20050617:
    
    Moved the object cache operations into the OS interface
    layer (OSL) to allow the host OS to handle these operations
    if desired (for example, the Linux OSL will invoke the
    slab allocator).  This support is optional; the compile
    time define ACPI_USE_LOCAL_CACHE may be used to utilize
    the original cache code in the ACPI CA core.  The new OSL
    interfaces are shown below.  See utalloc.c for an example
    implementation, and acpiosxf.h for the exact interface
    definitions.  Thanks to Alexey Starikovskiy.
            acpi_os_create_cache
            acpi_os_delete_cache
            acpi_os_purge_cache
            acpi_os_acquire_object
            acpi_os_release_object
    
    Modified the interfaces to acpi_os_acquire_lock and
    acpi_os_release_lock to return and restore a flags
    parameter.  This fits better with many OS lock models.
    Note: the current execution state (interrupt handler
    or not) is no longer passed to these interfaces.  If
    necessary, the OSL must determine this state by itself, a
    simple and fast operation.  Thanks to Alexey Starikovskiy.
    
    Fixed a problem in the ACPI table handling where a valid
    XSDT was assumed present if the revision of the RSDP
    was 2 or greater.  According to the ACPI specification,
    the XSDT is optional in all cases, and the table manager
    therefore now checks for both an RSDP >=2 and a valid
    XSDT pointer.  Otherwise, the RSDT pointer is used.
    Some ACPI 2.0 compliant BIOSs contain only the RSDT.
    
    Fixed an interpreter problem with the Mid() operator in the
    case of an input string where the resulting output string
    is of zero length.  It now correctly returns a valid,
    null terminated string object instead of a string object
    with a null pointer.
    
    Fixed a problem with the control method argument handling
    to allow a store to an Arg object that already contains an
    object of type Device.  The Device object is now correctly
    overwritten.  Previously, an error was returned.
    
    ACPICA 20050624:
    
    Modified the new OSL cache interfaces to use ACPI_CACHE_T
    as the type for the host-defined cache object.  This allows
    the OSL implementation to define and type this object in
    any manner desired, simplifying the OSL implementation.
    For example, ACPI_CACHE_T is defined as kmem_cache_t for
    Linux, and should be defined in the OS-specific header
    file for other operating systems as required.
    
    Changed the interface to AcpiOsAcquireObject to directly
    return the requested object as the function return (instead
    of ACPI_STATUS.) This change was made for performance
    reasons, since this is the purpose of the interface in the
    first place.  acpi_os_acquire_object is now similar to the
    acpi_os_allocate interface.  Thanks to Alexey Starikovskiy.
    
    Modified the initialization sequence in
    acpi_initialize_subsystem to call the OSL interface
    acpi_osl_initialize first, before any local initialization.
    This change was required because the global initialization
    now calls OSL interfaces.
    
    Restructured the code base to split some files because
    of size and/or because the code logically belonged in a
    separate file.  New files are listed below.

    ACPICA 20050526 from Bob Moore <robert.moore@intel.com>
    
    Implemented support to execute Type 1 and Type 2 AML
    opcodes appearing at the module level (not within a control
    method.)  These opcodes are executed exactly once at the
    time the table is loaded. This type of code was legal up
    until the release of ACPI 2.0B (2002) and is now supported
    within ACPI CA in order to provide backwards compatibility
    with earlier BIOS implementations. This eliminates the
    "Encountered executable code at module level" warning that
    was previously generated upon detection of such code.
    
    Fixed a problem in the interpreter where an AE_NOT_FOUND
    exception could inadvertently be generated during the
    lookup of namespace objects in the second pass parse of
    ACPI tables and control methods. It appears that this
    problem could occur during the resolution of forward
    references to namespace objects.
    
    Added the ACPI_MUTEX_DEBUG #ifdef to the
    acpi_ut_release_mutex function, corresponding to the same
    the deadlock detection debug code to be compiled out in
    the normal case, improving mutex performance (and overall
    subsystem performance) considerably.  As suggested by
    Alexey Starikovskiy.
    
    Implemented a handful of miscellaneous fixes for possible
    memory leaks on error conditions and error handling
    control paths. These fixes were suggested by FreeBSD and
    the Coverity Prevent source code analysis tool.
    
    Added a check for a null RSDT pointer in
    acpi_get_firmware_table (tbxfroot.c) to prevent a fault
    in this error case.

    ACPICA from Bob Moore <robert.moore@intel.com>
    
    Implemented support for PCI Express root bridges
    -- added support for device PNP0A08 in the root
    bridge search within AcpiEvPciConfigRegionSetup.
    acpi_ev_pci_config_region_setup().
    
    The interpreter now automatically truncates incoming
    64-bit constants to 32 bits if currently executing out
    of a 32-bit ACPI table (Revision < 2). This also affects
    the iASL compiler constant folding. (Note: as per below,
    the iASL compiler no longer allows 64-bit constants within
    32-bit tables.)
    
    Fixed a problem where string and buffer objects with
    "static" pointers (pointers to initialization data within
    an ACPI table) were not handled consistently. The internal
    object copy operation now always copies the data to a newly
    allocated buffer, regardless of whether the source object
    is static or not.
    
    Fixed a problem with the FromBCD operator where an
    implicit result conversion was improperly performed while
    storing the result to the target operand. Since this is an
    "explicit conversion" operator, the implicit conversion
    should never be performed on the output.
    
    Fixed a problem with the CopyObject operator where a copy
    to an existing named object did not always completely
    overwrite the existing object stored at name. Specifically,
    a buffer-to-buffer copy did not delete the existing buffer.
    
    Replaced "interrupt_level" with "interrupt_number" in all
    GPE interfaces and structs for consistency.

    ACPICA 20050408 from Bob Moore
    
    Fixed three cases in the interpreter where an "index"
    argument to an ASL function was still (internally) 32
    bits instead of the required 64 bits.  This was the Index
    argument to the Index, Mid, and Match operators.
    
    The "strupr" function is now permanently local
    (acpi_ut_strupr), since this is not a POSIX-defined
    function and not present in most kernel-level C
    libraries. References to the C library strupr function
    have been removed from the headers.
    
    Completed the deployment of static
    functions/prototypes. All prototypes with the static
    attribute have been moved from the headers to the owning
    C file.
    
    ACPICA 20050329 from Bob Moore
    
    An error is now generated if an attempt is made to create
    a Buffer Field of length zero (A CreateField with a length
    operand of zero.)
    
    The interpreter now issues a warning whenever executable
    code at the module level is detected during ACPI table
    load. This will give some idea of the prevalence of this
    type of code.
    
    Implemented support for references to named objects (other
    than control methods) within package objects.
    
    Enhanced package object output for the debug
    object. Package objects are now completely dumped, showing
    all elements.
    
    Enhanced miscellaneous object output for the debug
    object. Any object can now be written to the debug object
    (for example, a device object can be written, and the type
    of the object will be displayed.)
    
    The "static" qualifier has been added to all local
    functions across the core subsystem.
    
    The number of "long" lines (> 80 chars) within the source
    has been significantly reduced, by about 1/3.
    
    Cleaned up all header files to ensure that all CA/iASL
    functions are prototyped (even static functions) and the
    formatting is consistent.
    
    Two new header files have been added, acopcode.h and
    acnames.h.
    
    Removed several obsolete functions that were no longer
    used.

commit 1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org>
Date:   Sat Apr 16 15:20:36 2005 -0700

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
